Final:

- floppy speed was never initialized to 100% in quickstart-mode
- default.uae ignored paths-panel configurations-path
- in some circumstances regular configuration was saved to
  hardware or host configuration directory
- enabling/disabling lores on the fly didn't always reset all
  internal variables correctly resulting in weird display

RC1:

- back2roots URL updated (was ancient http://back2roots.emuunlim.com/),
  abime.net URL added
- fixed uninitialized variable that may have caused problems in
  4-channel sound mode
- possible crash bug in beta13's blitter update fixed
- game-port panel joystick compatibility with older config files fixed
  (why is kbd1 = first keyboard layout but joy0 = first joystick?)

Beta 13:

- changed quickstart uae-config's floppy speed to turbo
- MOVEC control register 0x804 was incorrectly marked as 68040-only,
  but it really is 68020+. It seems I broke this in some 0.8.22 version
  without anyone noticing it.. (fixes AIBB crash in 68020-mode)
- directory filesystem deleted files/directories are now moved to
  Windows Recycle Bin (if RB is not disabled)
- release all inputdevices when entering debugger (and acquire them
  again after exiting) Fixes keyboard freeze on some Windows 2000
  systems
- last entry in Ports-panel mouse/joystick-selectbox was unselectable
- middle mouse button didn't work, stupid typo in b12's input cleanup
- removed "Windows mouse" mousewheel and number of buttons limits, there
  are programs that can send for example faked middle button messages
  even if real mouse has only 2 buttons etc..
- "Windows mouse" middle button = ALT-TAB fix
- disable quickstart media-check if quickstart-checkbox is not checked
- yet another active/inactive/minimized-fix
- added image+crc tooltip to df0-df3 windowed mode "leds"
  btw, for some reason SB_SETTEXT's SBT_POPOUT-mode don't do anything if
  non-classic skin in Windows XP is selected. (which means "leds" don't
  move "up" or "down") Any ideas?
- left click on status bar df0-df3 = insert disk, right click = eject,
  left click on power = gui, right click = reset. Left and right button
  doubleclicks are still free if someone needs more functions :)
- blitter non-ce/non-immediate approximate slowdown due to bitplane dma
  -code changed
- add support for other german keyboard layouts

Beta 12:

- "Syncronize clock"-feature is back, fixed random turbo clock
- gameport configuration defaults fixed
- added "4 Channel" audio mode (=feed all 4 Amiga channels directly
  to DirectSound device without 4->2 software mixing, was earlier only
  available with "-dsaudiomix" command line parameter)
- "Crux"-interpolation with stereo separation enabled fixed
  (readjustment of stereo separation GUI-settings are needed)
- show message if there is no Kickstart ROM selected and Kickstart
  replacement fails to run disk image in df0: (previous versions
  simply returned to GUI without saying anything..)
- "Could not load Kickstart ROM"-message readded (not sure why or when
  it disappeared..)
- kickstart replacement wasn't enabled if no Kickstart ROM was
  selected, but it worked if selected ROM couldn't be loaded.. fixed.
- input device renaming must be of course after sorting, not before..
- Added "Amiga 2000" to Amiga 500 model-title
- mousehack-support changed, mousehack-mode is only enabled when
  Amiga-side mousehack-program is running and new special
  "Mousehack mouse" is selected. Autoselecting mousehack-mode would
  have caused too many unsolvable problems. Without mousehack-program
  mousehack-mode works just like "Windows mouse"
- mousehack works in fullscreen mode. (=tablets work in fullscreen)
- quickstart only autosets configuration when "start in quickstart-mode"
  -checkbox is checked. "Set Configuration"-button can be used to
  set the config when checkbox is not checked.
- dragndrop rom type detection
- cd32-pad emulation improved, should be nearly perfect now,
  also default joystick/joypad cd32-button mappings changed
  (removed useless "firebutton") (CD32 pad info from schematic at:
  http://home.t-online.de/home/malibann/cd32gamepad/cd32gamepad.html)
- cd32 cdrom drive is now always redetected after every reset
- keyboard layout A/B/C compatibility with older versions fixed
  (check and resave your configs)
- changed default windowed resolution to 720x568

Beta 11: hopefully only bugs fixes left..

- improved game controller/mouse selection in "Game & IO-ports",
  even multimouse is now possible without need to use input-panel
  (but don't forget OS limits: 98/ME = two USB mice required,
  2000 = no multimouse support, XP = no mouse limits)
- changed naming of input devices with identical names
  (first is named "xxx [1]", second "xxx [2]" etc..)
- removed some REALLY obsolete win32-specific filesystem filename
  mangling functions. (for example ~ in file names didn't work)
  Testing needed!
- Action Replay freeze-key (page up) was unavailable for configuration
  even if Action Replay was not enabled, fixed. Again.
- USB keyboard led-support (may not work in all cases yet)
- more ALT-TAB fixes (this is so stupid, for example Direct3D-
  fullscreen mode sends minimized information differently than other
  regular DirectDraw fullscreen modes..)
- added "Windows Mouse" buttons 4 and 5, detect the real number of
  "Windows Mouse" buttons and wheel. NOTE: non-DirectInput maximum
  number of supported buttons is 5 (Windows 2000/XP) or 3 (9x/ME)
- added default mapping of mouse buttons 4 and 5 to ALT+CURSOR LEFT
  and ALT+CURSOR RIGHT (back and forward)
- it is now possible to dragndrop disk image(s) directly to any drive's
  path-string box

Beta 10b:

- "automatic" jump back to fullscreen after ALT-TAB fixed, I think..
- changed TD_GETGEOMETRY slightly, use CHS-values from RDB if RDB
  is detected, only "invent" the values if RDB is not detected.
- paths-panel manual path editing fixed
- flash ram manual editing fixed

Beta 10: lots of small things..

- Action Replay 2 and 3 ROM first 4 byte tweak, dumping the ROM under
  UAE (pointless?) results now exactly the same dump as on real A500
- debugger tracing commands didn't work in ROM
- added automatic KS patcher that disables A4000T ROM's
  "NCR scsi.device" -> A4000T ROM is back and working. (A4000T NCR
  scsi.device expects correct scsi hardware -> no hardware -> confused
  driver -> infinite loop..) Maybe pointless too but...
- some A500<>A1000<>CDTV<>CD32 on the fly switching bugs fixed
- 68020/68EC020-KS check didn't work correctly if
  shapeshifter-patch was enabled, fixed
- fixed possible crash when ALT-TABing from filtered fullscreen mode
- crash when saving new config and no old config file has been selected
- fixed corrupt logical disk format when creating standard 3.5"HD ADF
  (this has been broken since the beginning..)
- added TD_GETGEOMETRY (very rarely needed) support to uaehf.device
- optimized stereo separation/mixing algorithm, fixed incorrect config
  file entry name ("sound_stereo_mixing" -> "sound_stereo_mixing_delay")
- added missing KS 37.299 ROM in A600-ROM scan check
- don't touch WinUAE version number in registry if it is newer than
  current
- Quickstart "Host Configuration"-checkbox didn't remember previously
  selected configuration.
- added some example host configurations (800x600 and 640x480
  fullscreen and one windowed). I plan to add these and maybe some
  other (suggestions?) host-configurations with release version.
  (it will be optional component in installer)
- added configuration link selector and probably confusing
  ignore-checkbox to config panel (ignore = don't load linked config,
  load instead host config from regular config file or from user-forced
  file in Host-panel)
- fullscreen mode always used no-taskbarbutton-mode. fixed.
- automatically default to ASPI if uaescsi.device is enabled and
  OS is Windows9x or if user has no admin privileges
- don't crash if DirectInput fails to initialize (Why does
  DirectInput8Create() fail with "unspecified error" when running
  WinUAE under different user using Windows XP "Run as..."-feature?)
- use SetPriorityClass() under 2000/XP instead of SetThreadPriority()
  (now Task Manager shows same priority settings as WinUAE GUI)

Beta 9:

- replaced "mixed stereo" with stereo separation adjustment and made
  mixed stereo delay buffer size adjustable, original mixed stereo
  buffer size was 5. (don't ask about mixed stereo delay buffer, I
  have no idea whats the point :) (Idea from xtc)
- quickstart-mode reset button fix
- CDTV Extended 2.7 is back, 2.3 renamed to 2.30
- A4000T KS 3.1 removed (apparantly it is not compatible with UAE)
- improved Kickstart CPU compatibility check
- added misc-checkbox for hiding Windows Taskbar-button
  (that was much easier said than done..)
- windowed mode DFx,Power,etc.. "leds" now support non-96DPI modes
- added more hardfile/harddisk error logging (non-blocksize aligned
  or out of bounds accesses)
- added mostly useless 1.8M BogoRAM selection (there were A500 2M
  expansions but 0.2M was lost "under" custom chip address space)
- included translation DLL for testing (but note that this won't be
  the final version)

Beta 8:

- added missing A500+ and A600 ROM scan messages
- model info, ROM scan messages are now translatable
- removed yellow "!" from message-dialogs
- possible fix for ancient "black bar at right border when
  centering is enabled and screen width is large enough"-bug
- remove floppies from disabled drives in quickstart-mode
- quickstart disk history was duplicated when selecting new image
  and image change caused configuration update.
- "config_hardware_path" and "config_host_path" config entries added
  They can be used to link two config files. I am not yet sure how to
  add GUI support for saving linked config files..
- replaced RDB filesystem relocator's 68020+ only instructions with
  68000-compatible instructions (oops..)
- added model info to Kickstart ROM information
- removed hack/beta KS 3.1 40.70 (0x917100a0, hack/beta) and CDTV
  Extended 2.7 (not confirmed), added A4000T KS 3.1 40.70 (0x75932c3a)
  (Kickstart info by Rodney Hester)

Beta 7:

- fixed beta 6 quickstart problems
- added A500Plus and A600-entries (A500P with KS 37.175 and A600 with
  37.350/37.300) and CDTV (with warning)
  Yes, I changed my mind again :)
- added very expanded example configuration to quickstart-page

Beta 6:

- better 68000 exception 3 (address error) return address
  calculation (fixes yet another copy protection)
- cycle-exact mode timing fixes (broke in 0826b1.. caused some
  (many?) copylock-protected images to fail, also Dynamic Hires images
  look much better now but it is not yet perfect.
- removed some unneeded code from ce-mode cpu
- removed compiler.c and compiler.h. No idea when this was last
  used (or maybe it was never really used?)
- added volume level value to sound panel
- keyboard led select boxes worked strangely, fixed
- more 68000 DIVU/DIVS undefined flags defined :)
- added more RDB parsing messages to log
- Overkill AGA graphics fix. WARNING: may cause graphics
  problem (shifted image) in other AGA games/demos.
  Keep your eyes open!
- don't check quickstart disk image bootable-status anymore after
  emulator has been started
- new (not yet released) caps library required
- force ROM rescan if WinUAE version info in registry is older
  than current version
- bootblock crc check added to quickstart insert-disk check
- german keyboard #-key hack fix (Bernd Roesch)
- disable chipset speed settings if 68000 and cycle-exact enabled
- quickstart and paths icons added (Jani Wilen)
- wider harddrive-dialogs
- added "enable RDB-mode"-button to hardfile dialog
  (it only clears sectors, surfaces and reserved-fields)
- dialog should really appear correctly in fullscreen mode
- added CRC32-tooltip to quickstart DF0-select box arrow.
  (why? bug reports without enough info to confirm used image..)


Beta 5:

- dragndrop didn't close filehandles (left files that were not
  possible to delete or rename until WinUAE was exited)
- save state key shortcuts fixed (broke in beta 2, I think)
- added tooltip support to every control in GUI (this is quite
  stupid: All dialog strings with "[]" in them is split to two pieces.
  Dialog string is replaced with leftmost piece and tooltip is added
  with rightmost piece. Stupid but this does not need any extra resources,
  is automatic and it is easy for translators)
- example tooltips added to keyboard A, B and C-checkboxes
- more tooltips to cpu, disk and chipset tab. Help needed, I am not going
  to write any more myself..
- configuration tooltip fixed
- replaced tooltips with balloon tooltips
- disk history weirdness fixed (randomly changing disks etc..)
- added message if "Add harddrive" does not detect any drives
- updated NT-based Windows' admin privilege-check
- removed ECS Denise-selection. OCS Agnus + ECS Denise was never used
  (probably does not even work on real Amigas)
- update last used config file name when saving config
- more common notifications/error messages can be translated
- added message that appears only once when saving to standard adf and
  saved track is not standard AmigaDOS format.

Beta 4:

- return back to GUI if Kickstart ROM is missing and Kickstart
  replacement fails (do we even need this anymore?)
- don't add nonexisting files to disk history
- added saveimage delete-button to disk-panel (only visible when there
  is saveimage present for selected image)
- added -diskswapper=image1.adf,image2.adf,...-command line parameter
- startup-zlib-dialog-crash fixed
- improved rom scanner, now Kickstart ROMs/keyfile are detected even
  if all roms are stored in single zip...
- stupid disk writing bug fixed, causes some crappy disk routines to
  save corrupted data, for example SWOS. (was introduced in 0.8.26)
- paraport direct parallel port support improved
  (busy signal was inverted, printing works now)
- mapped AmigaDOS H-flag to Windows hidden-flag. This leaves S-flag
  but there are no Windows flags left..
- moved "no uaefsdb"-checkbox to harddisk-panel
- added scaling support to all software filters
- testing tooltips in model selection area (texts by G. Chillemi and me)
  Good or bad idea?
- added OCS A500 0.5M+0.5M configuration on top of list. Apparantly
  OCS A500 is the most common Amiga 500 (except here in Finland or
  something)
  
Beta 3:

- hardware/host-settings should now really work..
- filter presets added
- "clear registry" really removes all new keys now
- changed default joystick to keyboard layout B
- set default sound filter to emulated
- filter presets (saves filter settings plus lores, doubling,
  correct aspect and centering settings from display page)
- added avioutput path to paths-page

Beta 2:

- added missing Cloanto KS 1.3 and 3.1 CRCs
- Reset-button was enabled when inserting disk even if
  emulator was not yet started
- less ROM-check messages
- disable serial options if no serial port selected
- removed A500+/A600-configs (not much use here)
- removed CDTV config (not much point until CDROM works)
- don't load quickstart-page's config when entering quickstart
  page for the first time if quickstart-mode is not enabled
- don't disable Start-button
- clear disk image paths when in quickstart mode (=don't load
  floppies from default.uae)
- added second drive, only enabled when RAM size is 1MB or
  larger.
- quickstart reset handling improved
- obsolete rom.key-GUI option removed
- hardware/host configurations save/load/delete fixed
- added simple JIT on/off switch (only sets cache to zero
  or max and it does not remember old value)

Beta 1:

I have been thinking of bumping version number to 1.0 in next
release. Emulation seems to be good enough, GUI looks ok
and now finally there is long-awaited "quickstart"-mode for
"normal" emulator users.

I really request comments about Quickstart-mode GUI. One or
two drives? Build-in configs are ok? ROM-messages are ok?

It is possible I have gone really too far this time..

- more support for small devices, debugger can be disabled
  by editing sysconfig.h
- dialogs don't appear behind the screen in fullscreen modes
- warn only once when saving state with harddisk(s) enabled
- chip ID-register (VPOSR upper byte) never reported ECS Agnus
  (broke in 0.8.26)
- TST.x Ax, TST.x (d16,PC), TST.x (d8,PC,Xn), CMP.x #x,(d16,PC)
  and CMP.x #x,(d8,PC,Xn) are 68020+ only. There are probably
  more to fix.. (some 68000/68010-instructions don't support
  all addressing modes)
- SMBFS, FAT95, AmigaNCP map Windows System-flag to AmigaDOS Pure-flag,
  so do it also in UAE filesystem emulation, also archive bit was
  inverted
- configuration file scanner didn't work correctly if directory
  was deeper than 1 level, fixed, also added limit to 3 levels
- added CRC32 ROM-detection (only common official ROMs supported)
- show selected ROM's name instead of filename in ROM-page if
  selected ROM is in CRC32-list
- all detected ROMs are added to ROM-filename selectbox
- statefile ROM CRC32 is used to select correct ROM when loading state
- ROM path is scanned when starting WinUAE for the first time,
  ROM path is changed or Rescan ROMs-button is clicked
- added Paths-page
- added QuickStart-page (for users that only want to run floppy based
  programs without need to know anything about configuration)
- rom.key-path is basically obsolete now, WinUAE automatically tries
  all possible locations for rom.key. (current dir, rom-path etc..)
  Any reasons for not removing the rom.key-path from GUI?
- switching from A1000/CD32/CDTV mode to normal-mode and back works
  now correctly
- changed default configuration to regular Amiga 500-config, also
  some other default config tweaks
- in quickstart-page inserted disk image's bootblock is checked
  - no bootblock/wrong checksum = don't accept image
  - OFS bootblock -> continue
  - FFS/FFS+INT bootblock -> autoselect KS2.04 config (if previous
    config was < KS 2.04)
  - FFS+DIRCACHE bootblock -> autoselect KS3.0 config (if previous
    config was < KS 3.0)
- "Clear registry"-button in paths-page can be used to remove
  all new WinUAE registry entries, for easier beta testing
- added hardware/host-specific configurations, autoload checkbox =
  automatically load selected hardware/host-only config after "regular"
  config

TODO:

- new icons

btw, is there are any problems using names like "Amiga" or "Kickstart"?

0.8.27

Beta 4: (final?)

- AVIOutput tweaks (enable-button is disabled until codec(s)
  are selected, don't clear selected codec(s) after recording
  is stopped, no more clicks in recorded sound while alt-tabbing
  and more)
- COPJMP-delay was 2 cycles too short, fixes 2000AD-intro
  (properly this time!) and Total Triple Trouble-intro's missing
  characters (sprites)
- debugger: added illegal access logger (any memory access to
  non-existing memory or "non-official" custom chip/cia address is
  logged) enable with "wd"-command, delete addresses with "wd x y"
  where x = start address y = length of range.
- A1000 boot rom works again (b1)
- some centering tweaks

Beta 3:

- don't exit if using 68020+ Kickstart ROM without 68020 CPU
- fixed rare null filter crash
- full collision setting fixed. Game called "Rotor" does
  require working CLXDAT collision bit 0 (="full collision")
  This is the first known program that needs full collision!
- 68000 CLR.L/NEG.L/NEGL.X/NOT.L data access order finally fixed
  (read first word, read second word, write second word, write
  first word) This is important because there are some demos
  that do CLR.L $DFF088..
- contents of zipped files in disk history-list had extra space
  in the beginning of filename. fixed. (b1)

Beta 2:

- added correct return value in 68000+more compatible/ce-mode when
  accessing CIA-address space without selecting any CIA (both
  CIA selection address bits 12 and 13 set) rtclock, buggy
  A1000 "Insider"-memory expansion's real-time clock setting
  utility program works now without crashing.
- state saves were saved in random point instead of at the
  beginning of vblank. (broke somewhere during 0.8.22 or so)
- debugger 'am'-command fixed
- removed disk swapper auto disk insert when loading config.
  It wasn't too good idea. (disk in swapper position 1, eject disk,
  save config and load config -> disk is back in df0..)
- vertical/horizontal centering fixed! (or at least it is much
  improved) Does not fix bar in right side of screen if using too
  large resolution
- MIDI does not require selected serial port anymore
- "exter_int_helper: unknown native action" is confirmed fixed
  (bug has been there since native2amiga.c was originally created..)
- re-added SPCFLAG_DOINT, JIT seems to have too weird timing to
  work without it in some cases.. Non-JIT modes still use new and
  more compatible method.
- fixed crash in CDTV-mode (broke in 0826B1)
- D3D and OpenGL mode fullscreen ALT-TAB fixed
- harddisk "bad blocksize" error (broke in b1)
- typing to disk image text boxes was ignored, fixed
- bug in kickstart loader fixed (b1, 256K ROMs only)

Beta 1:

- loading empty config/directory crashes (broke in beta 4)
- ports-page's joystick/mouse radiobuttons were not initialized
- added some source configuration options for low memory devices
- config file scanner ignored extension of files and scanned
  ALL files in configurations-directory, even binary files..
- GUI works with non-96 DPI font settings (arg, only bug was
  different font in "panel"-dialog than "page"-dialogs..) 
- removed "Highest" priority setting. It was mostly useless and
  slightly dangerous too.
- added check for too small hardfiles (zero or smaller than block
  size), also block size set to zero is not anymore allowed.
  (no more "tried to seek out of bounds! (FFFFFFFFFFFFC000 >= 0)"
  error message)
- JIT got confused and crashed if CPU setting was modified or
  JIT-enabled state file was loaded
- OpenGL fullscreen mode now uses DirectDraw to change screen's
  resolution instead of ChangeDisplayMode(). ALT-TAB works now
  properly.
- added missing semaphore-protection to native2amiga.c
  (fixes random "exter_int_helper: unknown native action xxx"
  errors and freezes when using for example uaescsi.device
  and hardfile(s) at the same time) NOT CONFIRMED YET
- interrupt delay in JIT mode reintroduced with much smaller
  and safe delay. (AB 3D II works again)
- new rtg.library, 20-30 times faster pixel read function in
  32-bit Picasso96 modes. Used in alphablending. (Bernd Roesch)
- fixed forever repeating "...because desktop is too small for
  the specified window size.."
- only add images inside zip to history if there are more than
  one image
- saving config: add ".uae"-extension to config file name if
  missing
- buffer overflow in drive click code fixed

0826

Beta 6:

- enter disk swapper for the first time, press up, first image
  disappears, fixed.
- ancient MIDI-IN freeze bug finally fixed
- module ripper's dialog boxes appeared "behind" WinUAE's screen
  in fullscreen modes
- disk image history list: move selected item to top of list
- move ripper to output-page (path etc.. improvements won't be
  implemented until 0.8.26 has been released)
- entering and exiting gui didn't restore 8-bit Picasso96-palette
  if opening GUI didn't force drop to desktop
- use GUI's real size (Windows XP styles can make it bigger than
  default) instead of hardcoded 640x480 when determining if GUI
  fits to current fullscreen mode
- more FDI2 updates
- added workaround to "turbo speed"-problem in non-ce modes
  (for example Battle Squadron cracktro by Freestyle)
- END+Fx-disk change shortcuts didn't add image to history list,
  fixed
- disabled interrupt delays in JIT-mode. That was not too good
  idea.. (crashed some programs)
- configuration "save as"-button used wrong path, fixed

Beta 5:

- "... Switching to full-screen display."-messages didn't work
  and crashed the emulator.. (oops)
- don't show paths in disk swapper-page
- disk swapper crash fixed (stupid bug, missing "break;" oops*2)
- loading config file copies inserted disk images in disk drives
  to disk swapper and also fills empty drives from disk swapper
  automatically.
- reload configuration file list after loading new config and
  emulation has already been started
- don't restart immediately if loading new config and show gui
  is not ticked and emulation has already been started
- fixed debugger memwatch point command's parsing of 'rw'
- cycle exact blitter/cpu-timing was broken since beta 1..
  (Robotics Life and others again..) I tried to store 0x100 to
  8-bit buffer.. (and oops^2)
- Pro Wizard module ripper included! (http://asle.free.fr/prowiz/)
  Supports over 50 packed tracker formats, automatically converts
  them back to standard Protracker format.
- enabling warp-mode (END+PAUSE) does not freeze the emulator in
  JIT-modes anymore
- moved multirevolution (= copy protections that use weak bits)
  code from common disk emulation to disk image-specific code
- improved FDI2 decoding (Vincent Joguin)

Beta 4:

- made debugger t and z -commands log all exceptions
- state save/restore added to input-tab
- dropped configuration file separation. maybe in next release,
  will need much more design time..
- FPU emulation bug fix. Fxxx.B #yy,FPz-style commands used wrong
  address (high byte instead of low byte) to fetch immediate value.
  It seems this has always been broken..
- configuration load/save page now remembers last selected config
  file
- m68k shift instructions timing improved in cycle-exact mode

Beta 3:

  NOTE: ignore the "Type"-select box in configuration page. It will
  change in next beta. Comments are not accepted :)

- caps bitcell timed track + saveimage crash fixed
- made GUI slightly smaller and improved child-dialog positioning
- updates systray icon if explorer restarts
- dropping config file to gui or window restarts emulation immediately
  if "Show GUI on startup"-checkbox in new config file is unchecked
- undocumented filesys_no_uaefsdb-config option added to GUI
  (prevents creation of new UAEFSDB-files which means all comments,
  protection flags not supported by host filesystem are lost, also it
  prevents creation of file names with "illegal" characters inside
  of emulation)
- "Knin Peaks" disk emulation fix broke software that set DSKLEN = 0
  (usually used by some copy protections) Fixed.
- store windowed GUI position in registry. GUI in fullscreen is
  always centered.
- JSR-instruction's prefetch fixed (protection code in original
  Datastorm)
- Windows XP styles supported
- 68000 exception processing stack pushes are now executed in
  exactly the same order as real 68000 does them (ce-mode only)
- D-channel only blit with ALWM or AFWM != 0xffff fixed
  (ce-mode only, Elfmania loading screen)
- caches configuration file list, reload only when saving
  or deleting.
- refresh rates in parenthesis don't anymore get reset to default
  (parenthesis = display driver does not support selected rate
  but it still may be available if some tweaking program is in use)
- added supported refresh rates to winuaebootlog.txt
- debugger breakpoints and memwatch points work now even if address
  register's high 8 bits contain crap and UAE is emulating 24-bit
  address space (copy protections..)
- implemented more correct interrupt delays and removed now obsolete
  SPCFLAG_DOINT, also (temporarily?) added experimental 68020+
  interrupt "fix" which may not be safe..
- POTGO fix (even "simple" io-port handling is complex in Amiga..)
  fixes for example The Band's Human Killing Machine trainer
- audio emulation tweaks. noise in Warhead and Hammerfist, 100 most
  remembered C64 tunes freeze and most importantly, without breaking
  Mission Elevator :)
- compressed state file Action Replay bug fix (but AR statefile
  support isn't too stable)
- added missing address error exception check in exception handler
  (and another copy protection works..)

Beta 2:

- full drag'n'drop support, config files/disk images/state files/roms
  supported.
- entering gui from smaller than 640x480 fullscreen mode fixed

Beta 1:

- GUI update! I am expecting lots of suggestions..
- Configuration Load/Save-page updated, directory support addded
- replaced floppy text box with select box, works as a combined disk
  image text box and history list (30 last used images, also
  automatically lists images inside zips) History list is stored in
  registry.
- added Disks-page for quick disk swapping (work in progress)
- systray icon and menu
- new icons (Jani Wilen)

- scsi logging improved and moved to non-host specific code
- AmiTradeCenter (ftp-client) bsdsocket emulation compatibility fix (SR)
- gethostname() CTRL-C-signal fix (SR)
- added debugger audio channel enable/disable command
  (am <channel mask>)
- Final (...) sprite-bitplane collision fix (Aunt Arctic Adventure)
- IRQ level 7 didn't wake CPU up from possible STOP-state
- END+PAUSE warp-mode sets frameskip temporarily to 10 (2-8x speedup)
  except in cycle-exact mode (ce-mode's timing needs zero frameskip)
- added Quit emulator -option to input source list
- MODE SENSE/SELECT 6<>10 translation bug fix, 4 last data bytes were
  replaced with random data (usually zeros) Was not noticed because
  most programs use larger buffer than required.
- cause bus error exception (and logs current CPU state) if program
  jumps to non-existing memory and CPU is 68020+. ("Your Amiga program
  just did something terribly stupid")
- added exception handler that tries to trap instruction opcode
  accesses. You see small dialog box explaining the situation. it
  will be removed in release version. This usually happens when memory
  gets corrupted and program flow "falls" off the end of memory bank.
  These two fixes should prevent most 68020 and/or JIT WinUAE crashes
  without any perfomance loss.
- CE-mode 68000 instruction tweaks here and there
  (I found out that you can use special blitter mode to "log" data bus..
  More fixes later)
- JIT is confirmed compatible with Windows XP SP2's data execution
  prevention (missed three smaller buffers in previous DEP fix)
- crash automatically creates minidump file to WinUAE's directory
  (winuae_yyyymmdd_hhmmss.dmp) Minidumps helps debugging the crash.
  Zip and send the file if I request it.
- RTS/RTD/RTE return address exception 3 fix
- Picasso96 WaitForVSync fixed, demo "Fake Electronic Lightshow" by
  Ephidrena is now usable in RTG-mode.
  Windowed mode = Virtual vsync. Uses frame rate from gui, default = 60
  Fullscreen = Virtual vsync. Uses fullscreen mode's refresh rate.
  Fullscreen + Vsync = real vsync.
  btw, before someone asks after checking the sources: update is
  "hidden" in filesys.asm..
- zipped statefiles and zipped dms files work again
- ancient 8-bit Picasso96-mode palette problem solved
- don't crash if emulated harddisk is removed while emulation is
  running
- disk emulation fix (Knin Peaks by Reality)
- cycle-exact single channel blit speed fix (very undocumented
  feature..)
  fixes slowdown in demos Revival and How 2 Skin a Cat.

0.8.25:

- even more improved AVIOutput. Added enable/disable button, entering GUI
  does not stop the recording anymore. Picasso96 modes supported.
  (config file support will be added in future version)
- cycle exact blitter B-channel handling fix (Arte)
- drivesound: don't play "snatch"-sound if drive is empty
- "2000AD"-fix removed, it isn't really right either, later...

Beta 3: (final?)

- added uaescsi.device logging, enable it with -scsilog command line parameter
- Windows XP multimouse really works now
- added uaescsi.device ATAPI INQUIRY and MODE SENSE/SELECT 6<>10 translation code,
  fixes IDE CDROM compatibility problems with PlayCD and probably others too.
  (thanks to Oliver Kastl) TEST THIS!
- added frame limit -checkbox to avioutput page. checked = disable frame limit
  and don't output sound, unchecked = frame limit enabled and sound output enabled.
  (maybe somebody wants to record and play the game at the same time..)

Beta 2:

- drive sound sample rate conversion code was total crap..
- calcdiw() vpos >= minfirstline-check re-commented, correct place is in decide_line()
  (corrupted some regular Workbench native screen modes)
- display/resolution enumeration code updates
- desktop size check corrected
- increased supported input devices from 4 to 6
- some small directinput cleanups
- bsdsocket emulation update. CNet's SMTPd works now. (Stephan Riedelbeck)
- don't use bitcell timing buffer when writing to disk..
- avioutput is now much faster (on some display cards it was already fast but
  on others it was very slow, about max 5fps..)
  Display data is fetched directly from UAE's internal buffer instead of using
  slow reading from display RAM if any display filter is enabled (except D3D or OGL)
  Also display size and depth config options were removed, now you get exactly
  the same display as you see. (I didn't want to add complex display depth
  conversion code when you can easily do the same by changing WinUAE's display
  settings..)

Beta 1:

- "Windows mouse" doubleclicking fixed
- drive sound volume was not saved to config file
- right border is not clipped anymore even if program uses max overscan. Finally..
  (Settlers, Pinball Illusions etc..) NOTE: screen position has changed a little.
- filter display buffer width increased to 736, old 708 was too small for max overscan.
  (noted here because it can also affect screen position slightly in filter-modes)
- fixed display corruption in programs that update DDFSTRT just when display
  starts. Fixes Mystic Tunes by Vertical, Bierkrug-tro by TEK, Forgotten Realms
  Slideshow '90 by Fraxion and probably much more..)
- "more compatible" now enables very basic prefetch emulation in non-JIT
  68010-68040 CPU models. (very rarely needed, I currently know only 2 programs)
- multimonitor code didn't ignore disabled displays, caused DX errors when
  WinUAE started.
- input code didn't check max number of detected devices, having more than 4
  mice, joysticks or keyboards in input tab crashed WinUAE.
- don't start bitplane dma until vpos >= minfirstline (comparison was commented
  out for some reason) Fixes old demo Back in bizness by 2000AD
- RTG-RAM start address was not saved to statefile, restoring it caused RTG
  RAM being mapped over chip RAM.. (not really problem because full Picasso96
  state is not supported yet)


0.8.24

Beta 3:

- drive sound was mixing (empty) sounds even if all drive sounds were disabled
- added "Windows mouse" to input-tab. It has exactly the same "feeling" as WinUAE's
  mouse before directinput-input code was implemented.
- fixed stupid debugger bug, remove breakpoint-command didn't check if breakpoint was already removed..
- "saveimages" were limited to "parent"-image's max number of tracks (for example writing
  to track 80 was ignored if parent image was standard 80 track (0-79) adf)
- lores-checkbox is back, it wasn't as useless as I originally thought..
- debugger 't'-command can now be used to step more than 1 instruction (t <number>)
- cycle-exact BLITPRI timing fix (Robotics Life, probably others too..)
- improved 68k MUL and DIV -instruction timing in ce-mode
- improved FDI 2.0 support

Beta 2:

- more debugger updates, search-command s <"string">/<hexvalues> [<addr]> [<length>]
  bl lists all stored "state recorder" states
- F12 now works even if all keyboard(s) are disabled in input-tab..
- added volume-slider to sound-tab, added volume up/down/mute shortcuts
  (end+numpad minus, end+numpad plus and mute = end+numpad star, also mapped to "multimedia" keys)
- hide single raw mouse, having two identical mice is too confusing I think.
- moved some hardcoded GUI-strings to resource
- power/led/etc led initialization fixed (editing the GUI before starting the emulation didn't
  update all necessary variables, editing on the fly worked fine)
- display frequency-setting affects now Picasso96-modes (no more default refresh rate)
- drive sound emulation :) (James Bagg, me)
  You can also use external samples if you put files called drive_click_xxx.wav,
  drive_spin_xxx.wav, drive_startup_xxx.wav and drive_snatch_xxx.wav (xxx = whatever you want,
  "click" is the only mandatory sample) to directory called <winuae path>\uae_data\ (better suggestions?)
- fullscreen multimonitor support
- better multimonitor compatibility (use correct display limits instead of primary display
  limits when positioning WinUAE's main window, non-primary screen overlay mode works etc..)
- "state recorder" is now mostly working. It takes automatic state saves every x seconds to its internal
  buffer (size is also configurable). "Rewind"-key can be configured in input-tab or also END+numpad /
  can be used. (This feature may not be in next official release)

Beta 1:

- don't ignore frame skip setting when capturing AVI
- implemented "memory state recorder" (don't ask about it yet..)
- bsdsocket updates from Stephan Riedelbeck
  fixes TCP device TCP:<port>, Apache and maybe other programs too.
- Windows XP multi-mouse support and DirectInput mouse-handling updates
  Windows XP-only: Input-tab now lists regular DirectInput-mouse and
  one or more "raw" mouse.
  Windows 9x/ME: only USB-mice can be handled separately, PS/2 mouse is always
  only connected to "supermouse" (DirectInput system default mouse that combines all
  separate mouse events, marked with '*' in input-tab)
  -> two USB mice are required for two mouse games under 9x/ME
  and finally, Windows 2000 does not have any support for multiple mice,
  all you get is single "supermouse".
  Big note: currently you need to disable default-mouse first if you want any
  events from non-default mouse.
- fixed JIT default settings without loading any configuration
  (log was filling with JIT error messages..)
- cleaned up Kickstart ROM loader part of memory.c
- saving compressed state file without zlib1.dll didn't correctly fall back to non-compressed mode
  (created corrupted statefiles with completely empty memory chunks..)
- crash after 4th or 5th state save finally fixed (very embarrassing mistake..)
- fixed crash when Picasso96 was enabled and graphics filter GUI was accessed
- FDI 2.0 support (not complete yet)
- lots of debugger improvements (much more useful now..)
 - f-command extended:
    f without parameters = break when PC not in ROM and current instruction is not
    0x4ef9 (don't break when executing library jump tables) Great for finding start
    address of bootblock.
    f i = break when PC points to RTS/RTR/RTE-instruction
    f i <opcode> = break when PC points to instruction opcode <opcode>
    f <addr> = add/remove new breakpoint (max 8)
    fd = remove all breakpoints
    f <addr1> <addr2> = break when <addr1> <= PC <= <addr2>
 - W-command's value-parameter can be decimal 12345 or hexadecimal (0x12345 or $12345)
    write size is byte if val < 256, word if 255 > val < 65536 and long if val > 65535.
    (previous version's write size was always long and was limited to chip ram)
 - memwatch break points added, w <0-3> <address> <length> <r/w/rw> [<value>]
    break when address space between address and address + length is accessed and
    if accessed value = <value> R = break only on reads, W = writes, RW = both
 - i-command: interrups and traps combined, VBR supported
 - custom register dump -command added (e), dumps the contents of all existing registers
   between 0xdff000-0xdf1ff.
 - CIA dump-output slightly modified, added TOD stopped status-flag
 - exiting debugger automatically creates "memory state" and b-command can be used
   to "rewind" (again, don't ask and don't try yet..)

0823

- small AUDxDAT fix (The Pawn's music was broken again..)

Beta 4:

- sprite emulation fix, broke in b1 (Hybris bullets/score)
- JIT cache is now allocated with PAGE_EXECUTE-flag (=JIT compiled code is allowed to run)
  Future Windows versions may not enable PAGE_EXECUTE by default due to security reasons.
- merged first source patch from Richard Drummond (http://www.rcdrummond.net/uae/)
- "figure_pixel_formats" possible infinite loop fixed
- zip/gzip support requires now new zlib1.dll instead of old zlib.dll
- forced blitter finish when saving state didn't work correctly in ce-mode (yeah, again..)
  (could cause infinite loop and freeze when saving)

Beta 3:

- non-ce blitter speed was wrong (broke in b1)
- MAPROM-emulation checkbox fixed and moved to ROM-tab
- problems with keyboard leds and priorities fixed
- slightly changed filter GUI (support for future 3x/4x filters)
- increased the range of filter size/position adjustments
- fixed bug that causes randomly lost characters received from serial port
- delay simultaneous disk inserts
- more commands (pause, turbo, irq7 etc..) added to input-tab
- scale is halved when in D3D/OGL-mode and resolution is smaller than 450*350
- clock sync option removed from GUI (causes too many problems)
- screenshot system freeze fixed (Windows9x/ME only)

Beta 2:

- don't complain about AGA requiring 16 bit if selected screen mode is 8-bit Picasso96-mode
- blitter emulation updates for very buggy programs that starts blitter before updating
  BLTCON0 and BLTCON1.. (old Psygnosis games) Was partially broken in R9. This fix was already
  included in B1 but I forgot to add changelog entry.
- fixed bug in blitter update that broke textured line mode
- uaescsi.device unit numbers always start from 0 (0 = first CDROM, 1 = possible second
  and finally other SCSI devices if available) Unit 0 is reserved for CDROM, first available
  unit number will be 1 if PC has no CDROM(s) but other supported SCSI devices.
  This makes CD filesystem installation more user friendlier.
- AHI emulation improvements (Bernd Roesch)
- state saving happens immediately after selecting state file name (woohoo..)
- complain if HD emulation is enabled when saving state
- added some unused keycodes to input-tab
- forced blitter finish when saving state didn't work correctly in ce-mode
  resulting in slightly corrupted state files.
- fixed very stupid mistake in CIA parallel port read routine, fixes parallel port
  joystick adapter, was broken in r8b4.
- Picasso96 faster solid window moving (Bernd Roesch)
- bcc.b was 2 cycles too fast in ce-mode (probably does not fix anything..)
- SPTI-CDROM didn't use shared mode, fixes media change detection problems
- added MAPROM-like feature (jumper on Blizzard's accelerator cards that map Kickstart
  ROM space to RAM) Enable-checkbox in misc-tab, uaelib function 80 returns mapped memory area.
  (0 = no support, 0xffffffff = not enabled, other = mapped RAM address, currently hardcoded
  to 0xe00000) Thanks to BlizKick's author for adding support

Beta 1:

- cpu usage meter implemented, results may be surprising...
  (note that in "fastest possible" it always shows 100%+ except when
  idle-mode is enabled and cpu is executing STOP-instruction)
- more undocumented features found, switching bitplane DMA on during DDF can have
  (at least) 3 different results:
  1: OCS only: nothing happens, bitplane fetches don't restart until next line
  (only this condition was emulated in older versions)
  2: ECS/AGA: fetches start normally if DMA was disabled outside of DDF or during
  current line (Sixth Sense Investigation's buggy copper list requires this..)
  3: ECS/AGA: display processing goes to "DDFSTOP passed"-condition immediately
  if DMA was disabled inside of DDF during any previous line
- add missing ".avi" automatically to avioutput filename
- overlay state was not reset when changing display modes, caused
  "The selected screen mode can't be <blahblah>"-message and forced
  unnecessary fullscreen mode.
- Page Up-key is available for user configuration if Action Replay is not enabled
- AWeb/IBrowse bsdsocket.library possible connection freeze/slowdown fix
  (Stephan Riedelbeck)
- switching from 68000 to 68020+ JIT-mode works and also fixed crash if switching
  from 68000+CE-mode to JIT-mode
- added hack that syncs CIA-TOD to host system's time. No need to run restoretime
  hack anymore. Checkbox in misc-tab. (hack = may cause compatibility problems)
- misc-tab split. Priority options moved to "Priority"-tab, added separate priority
  setting for active, inactive and minimized WinUAE.
- don't zero LOF-bit when executing customreset(), fixes original Shinobi
- bsdsocket SBTC_SIGIOMASK support, fixes Jabberwocky. Thread priority updates.
  (Stephan Riedelbeck)
- enforcer-style debugging improved (Bernd Roesch, Sebastian Bauer)
- restoring state didn't update floppy drive type correctly, fixed
- sometimes Amiga left mouse button got stuck when WinUAE lost focus, fixed

R9:

Beta 4:

- fullscreen height was incorrectly initialized when loading "old" config files
- avioutput width and height are correctly initialized
- null filter centering fixed (null is 1x, not 2x..)
- moving GUI over fullscreen software filter mode didn't refresh screen
- it is now possible to disable creation of UAEFSDB-files by adding
  unofficial config entry "filesys_no_fsdb=true" to config file
- automatic AVIOutput AVI split before file size goes over 2G
- GUI disappearing "behind" the screen in fullscreen mode fixed
- fixed "bug" (removed one consistency check..) in unzip code, some zip files
  didn't uncompress. Either unzip code I use is buggy or zip file is slightly
  broken (but winzip nor winrar didn't complain)
- AVIOutput sound and video sync problems fixed
- don't stop AVIOuput recording when entering END+Fx-disk change dialog
- "AGA 16-bit"-message box was incorrectly shown in windowed mode
- "saveimage"-floppy write support was again broken.. (it was possible to make
  zipped files write-enabled but writing to "saveimage" was still ignored..)

Beta 3:

- software filters fixed in windowed non-overlay mode
  Only Scale2X and Null support 32-bit, filter defaults to null if unsupported
  filter is selected. (wrong filter is better than black screen..)
- crash with sound disabled fixed
- another bsdsocket connection fix
- separated width and height for fullscreen and windowed modes
- hide lores-checkbox, lores is now automatically enabled if doubling is disabled
  (But maybe there was/is reason for separate horizontal and vertical doubling?)
- removed lots of compilation warnings
- replaced IOCTL_GET_GEOMETRY with more compatible IOCTL_CDROM_GET_GEOMETRY,
  properly fixes Windows 2000 CD32 CD detection.
- disable "Add Harddrive"-button if Windows is not NT-based

Beta 2:

- immediate blitter works again
- return 0xffffffff again when CPU >= 68020 and reading non-existing memory
- uncompressed RAM dump added to state save dialog
- loading config that mounts floppy drive don't anymore cause
  "no disk in drive A:"-dialog
- bsdsocket.library updates (Stephan Riedelbeck)
  - accept(socket, 0, 0) works, fixes IRCD
  - gethostbyname (Windows 9x only) could freeze for couple of seconds
  - reset socket error after gethostbyname, fixes AmyGate
  - connection failures on some systems
- scale2x, supereagle, 2xsai and super2xsai 2x filters integrated
  (all except scale2x borrowed from ScummVM project)
  filter configuration changed again, null filter added (=filter that
  does nothing but allows vertical and horizontal position adjustment)
  Currently only supports 16-bit modes (automatically forces 16-bit)
- added message and force 16-bit if 8-bit and AGA is enabled
- SPTI CDROM eject/insert media detection fix
- it seems IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY is only supported on Windows XP,
  added workaround that fixes CD32 emulation in non-ASPI mode on Windows 2000

Beta 1:

- fixed (I hope) compiler optimization bug, at least ROXL.W didn't set N-flag correctly
  maybe other rarely used instructions also had problems
  (broke CAPS Rick Dangerous 2 protection code)
- NTSC-mode vsync sound fixed
- don't crash in CD32 mode if both ASPI and SPTI are not available
- added CAPS-support (and CE-support) to mini-version due to popular request.
  I hope this does not cause any unnecessary slowdown. Executable is now
  2x bigger because of included "more compatible" and "ce"-cpu emulators.
- implemented 100% (I think..) exact blitter block-mode cycle diagram in ce-mode
  (minus possible bugs..) All tested "100+ bob" -routines work now without flashing.
  line mode cycle diagram is still not completely known.
- small ASPI CDROM media detection code change (may or may not help..)
- simplify audio emulation if 68020 or better selected. New code is "too" correct
  and causes timing problems if custom register/chip ram access is really too fast
  (fixes TBL's Tint-demo's music)
- sound calibration-button (may not be in final release)
- ticking/unticking 68000 "more compatible" checkbox on the fly now reconfigures the cpu
  emulator correctly, emulated program should not crash anymore.
- replaced "run at higher priority" with priority selection select box
- don't write obsolete config entries from old config file when saving
- D3D AVI capture works again (D3D AVI support code was mysteriously disappeared..)
- more audio changes again, old "Mission Elevator"-fix still wasn't correct enough
  (broke some music players) Audio state machine transitions from 1 to 5 seem to have
  unexplained delay(s). I think ME is the only game that requires this (and only because
  of stupid bug in ME's sound effect code..)
- SPTI CDROM media detection fixed (never noticed it because enabling debug-logging
  "fixed" the bug..)
- SPTI/ASPI CDROM possible crash fixed (both CD ROM fixes needed before I managed
  to install OS 3.9 without problems)

- R8

Beta 6:

- blitter always used exclusive fill mode, caused single pixel gap between
  filled polygons if program used inclusive mode (for example The Pink Circle by Arcane)
  I broke it accidentally some releases ago, I think...
- optimized Picasso96 blitter emulation (Bernd Roesch)
- always compress "quick" state files
- startup config file description scan crash fixed (needed more than 100 or so config files..)
- size of display resolution table was too small
- mapped "AppMenu"-key to right Amiga key

Beta 5:

- display width is now forced divisible by 8 when adjusting width on the fly
- miniwinuae and regular winuae display mode list is now sorted identically
- cpu speed calculation overflowed if cpu frequency was >~2.8GHz (latest P4 CPUs)
  caused huge slowdown
- JIT CPU nop's removed
- clear execbase when reseting if memory size (any memory) was adjusted
- don't mount non-existing virtual directories (prevents red screen reset loop)
- updated AHI support (Bernd Roesch)
- F6-state shortcut removed, replaced with END + <numeric keypad number> (restore)
  and CTRL or SHIFT + END + <numeric keypad number> (save)
  zero or period = currently selected statefile (includes period because my keyboard
  ignores simultaneous CTRL/SHIFT + END + 0..)
  1 - 9 = currently selected statefile + "_" + <number> added to end of file but
  before extension.
- force full screen update after loading state file
- disable beta 4's "Fighting Soccer fix" if CPU >= 68020. I think there are too
  many bad sound routines that fail with "too" fast CPU or custom chipset access speed.
- fixed (I hope..) rare filesys crash when rebooting (introduced in beta 2)

Beta 4:

- wav-output created slightly incorrect wave files and frequency was not updated correctly
- GUI CPU JIT-page update, enable JIT checkboxes only if "Force Settings"-checkbox is ticked
- AR2/3 ROM bank size fixed
- CD32 audio CD play/stop/pause commands changed slightly, may fix some ASPI problems
- Picasso96 windowed<>fullscreen switch and reseting while in Picasso96 mode fixed
  (broken in beta 2)
- audio emulation fix, AUDxLEN is copied to backup register when DMA is enabled but
  AUDxPT when first DMA fetch happens. (fixes "Fighting Soccer" referee speech)
- D3D/OpenGL automatic doubling if selected resolution is "too large"
- free old harddrives before loading new config
- CIA-A TOD rate was about 11% too fast (broke in R7B1)

Beta 3:

- joystick keyboard layout B and C 2nd firebutton mapping
  (Right and left shift) was wrong and caused crashes.
- CD32 media change detection works properly (again..)
- bsdsocket.library emulation works again (stupid merge error by me..)
- prevent badly crashing programs setting very crazy vblank frequencies
- pause CD32 cd audio when GUI is active
- decreased the rate of HD-led flickering because there are keyboards that
  are really slow in changing led state
- fixed 57600 to 56000 serial bitrate rounding

Beta 2:

- fixed extended ADF HD floppy support
- DirectX version check fixed, only D3D support requires DX9
- selected 3D-mode was not saved correctly to config file, fixed
- About-tab is back.. (broken in B1)
- call fixup_prefs_dimensions() after loading config
- POTGO/POTGOR emulation improved, more compatible CD32 pad emulation
- Picasso96 display mode id strings fixed (broken in B1)
- SCSI emulation was accidentally disabled in B1
- added Direct3D screenshot support
- removed Output-tab from mini-version
- compiler updated to Visual Studio Net 2003
- "intelligent" CD detection in CD32 mode
- lores, correct aspect and linedoubling can be changed on the fly
- added wav-sound output support to Output-tab (select "*.wav" from "Save As Type:"-select box)
- virtual directory harddisk mapped to read-only directory (for example network share)
  is forced read-only
- it is (finally?) possible to return back to GUI and/or load new configuration.
  "Load" and "Load from"-buttons are now always enabled, new "Exit"-button can be
  used to return back to GUI (with old configuration intact)
  WARNING: expect bugs and memory leaks..
- bsdsocket.library emulation updates (Stephan Riedelbeck)
- changed mini-version's default config to basic A500


Beta 1:

- source tree is now  more configurable. sysconfig.h contains defines that can be used
  to enable or disable emulation features like JIT, AGA, autoconfig, harddisks, drop
  all CPU features except 68000 etc..
  I hope this helps porting (Win)UAE to slower devices like some PDAs etc..
- win32_displaymode and PicassoResolution -structures merged
- DirectDraw fullscreen mode flags fix (Sane)
- added workaround for buggy sound drivers (ISA SB16, maybe others) that return zero as
  minimum and maximum allowed sample rate...
- fast copper was always disabled. oops..
- another "last_custom_value" tweak, fixes Sonic - Irrepressible intro in ECS-mode
- non-DMA audio mode properly emulated, fixes Mortville Manor's and Maupiti Island's speech
- ext2-adfs' write-protection check fixed
- Direct3D filtering and scaling implemented. Should be faster because D3D allows
  direct rendering to texture's memory space. Note, DX9 required due to stupid MS
  decision: opening child windows (F12-GUI etc..) while in D3D fullscreen mode is not
  supported by DX8 API (Window simply disappears "behind" the screen..)
  Unfortunately I get weird smearing effect when moving the GUI window (display driver bug?)
- display resolution and depth can be changed on the fly
- D3D/OpenGL mode image adjustments changed, size sliders at 0/0 = 1:1 display ratio
- joypad problems fixed, bug affected some pads that have "point-of-view hat"-style
  direction controller
- fixed rare filesystem crash when copying files to directory in virtual harddisk's root
- END+F6 = load from last selected state file, SHIFT+END+F6 = save to last selected state file
- game Barney and Freddy Mouse by Kingsoft needs CLXDAT bit 15 set ("not used" says HRM but
  always set on my A500 and A1200)
- exiting GUI with Cancel or ESC cancels state save/restore request
- Freespace demo JIT FPU bug fix (Bernd Roesch)
- FPU rounding bug fix (Bernd Roesch)
- fast copper state saved to config file (I don't see any other way to fix graphics bugs on
  some games that fast copper causes)
- CD32 joypad emulation works again (oops, has been broken quite a long time..),
  default CD32 keyboard joypad mapping fixed, default joypad config added


R7 (30.05.2003)

Beta 5:

- zipped ipf-image support (new CAPS plugin required). No official multidisk support yet.
  (unofficially you can add "/<name of file>" or "\<name of file>" to the end of path,
  for example "c:\caps\PinballFantasies.zip\PinballFantasies_CourseDisk1.ipf")
  new CAPS plugin only for beta testers included.
- "KickShifter" ROM checksum recalculation was wrong, fixes red screen with some Kickstart versions
- bsdsocket Windows 2000/XP AmTelnet SSH freeze fixed (Stephen Riedelbeck)
- new AHI driver, fix for wrong maxsamplesize, includes separate patch for DigiBooster Pro 
  slowdown (Bernd Roesch)

Beta 4:

- "SWIV-fix" wasn't working if lores-mode was ticked, fixed
- "sprites outside playfield"-fix is now working in lores mode, also fixes black bar that appeared
  when running programs that use hires or shres mode, BRDSPRT was enabled and mouse pointer was
  moved near right border
- fixed broken "ShapeShifter" Kickstart patch code, replaced with generic patcher
  (KS 3.0+ use separate code path for 68040+ which was not patched and KS 2.04 patch was just wrong)
- "fake RDB" filesystem updates, multiple non-RDB custom filesystems works now properly
- GUI filesystem selection crash bug fixed
- beta 3 keyboard input update wasn't complete (loading new config was using old incompatible code)
- selected sound sample rate wasn't updated correctly if sound driver didn't support selected rate
- rewritten and cleaned display refresh rate selection code
- more weird undocumented blitter line mode features emulated:
  - after first pixel, C-channel's address is copied to D-channel.
    (first pixel is written to address pointed by D-channel, all following pixels are written to
    C-channel's address) Fixes Frantic's Cardamom and Cardamon demos.
  - BLTAPT stays unchanged if A channel is disabled. I found this useless feature when running
    tests on my A1200, probably never really used..
- "collision detection does NOT change when you select either single- or dual-playfield mode"
  says HRM. BZZZT, WRONG! Sprite to playfield collision detection should be correct (?) now.
  Fixes Inferior and Sub Rally (I call it "Suck Rally" for obvious reasons..)
- sprite DMA start raster line in NTSC mode fixed. This was surprising, first visible line in
  PAL is 28, NTSC 27. But first possible PAL sprite DMA position is 25, NTSC start is line 20.
  I was expecting smaller difference. Tested on my PAL A1200 in NTSC-mode.

Beta 3:

- horiz centering bug fixed (could cause crashes)
- trace-mode fix. fixes CAPS Defenders of Earth trace-vector-decoder protection routine.
- POTGOR emulation fixed (Sound of Silents -music disk ugly right mouse button test code..
  here is snippet: cmp.w #$0100,$dff016; bne right_button_not_pushed; ...)
- sectors, surfaces and reserved are automatically zeroed if selected hardfile contains RDB
- multiple keyboards supported, config save crash/non-working keyboard fixed when MS SideWinder
  Virtual Keyboard driver is installed.
- MOVEC-instruction fix, register 3 is 68040 only, it is not supported by 68020 (ancient bug, fixes
  Aladdin AGA and Banshee AGA in 68020 mode. CPU detection code detected MMU due to bug..)
- SWIV scoreboard graphics bug fixed (was caused by very weird undocumented OCS/ECS-only hardware feature)
- input point-of-view hat controller support
- small audio hardware reset fix

Beta 2:

- 68020+ instruction bcc.l was broken in 68000/68010 mode when cycle-exact mode was implemented
  (is really useless version of bcc.b when run under 68000/68010), fixes Paradox cracked Nitro
- harddisk partition detection updates. It seems Windows sometimes lies about drive's partition table
  (drive really only contains RDB partitions but Windows still thinks there are some empty
  MBR partitions..)
- improved Action Replay state file support
- new misc-page layout, added "Run at higher priority"-checkbox to misc page (sets process priority to higher
  than normal when WinUAE is active, helps skips and jumps caused by background processes)
- sound frequency GUI updated, allowed frequency range is now from 8000 to 48000 (max 96000 if sound card supports it)
- some experimental and buggy copper code from beta 1 removed..
- audio filter emulation (formula from
  http://groups.google.com/groups?q=g:thl3970091855d&dq=&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&selm=5sntr1%243ki%241%40nef.ens.fr)
- button/key mapped to mouse direction wasn't working correctly, fixed
- another bsdsocket fix (Stephen Riedelbeck)

Beta 1

- audio emulation fixes (fixes Mission Elevator again, this time proper fix)
- removed obsolete code (I think so..) when bitplane count during the raster line was
  decreased (single line of crap between playing area and scoreboard on Mission Elevator)
- Rainbow Island works again (broke in beta 4)
- serial port settings can be changed on the fly
- changing printer on the fly works
- printer didn't work if also serial port was enabled
- added serial port "direct"-checkbox, forces 115200 bit rate, lowers latency,
  needed by some serial linked games (Lotus 2) when connecting two PCs running WinUAE
- partial Action Replay state file support
- bsd socketfix for Ping Traceroute UDP Ping (Stephan Riedelbeck) 
  If you can test diropus Magellan with FTP Lister so please test,if this work as before.
  Try to connect to de.aminet.net dir aminet/new with anon on
  If you get no error 22 report from diropus for 5 trys all work ok 
- replaced uae_int with level 2 interrupt (was level 6), fixes buggy HD installable
  demos/games that disable level 6 interrupt. Using level 2 is more compatible
  because A1200/A4000 IDE-controller and A590/A2091 use level 2 interrupt.
  Also fixed bug that added uae_int handler twice. Set priority of interrupt to 20 (A1200 IDE uses it)
  Fixes game Old Timer and demo Captured Dreams by The Black Lotus (and probably much more..)
- CIA OVL-bit is ignored in AGA Amigas
- proper emulation of POTxDAT counters, analog joystick support in input-tab
- blitter in linedraw mode is weird, D-channel can be disabled without any effect on drawn line, enabling
  C-channel is enough. (undocumented feature, fixes Great Fun #16 packdisk)
- added hack that fixes buggy demos that read accidentally from write-only or non-existing custom
  registers and expect sane return values. Fixes Captured Dreams, Industrial Fudge, Codetrash.
- changed sprite-attach handling, even sprite attach-bit must not be ignored because setting it
  does something interesting.. and thats another undocumented feature, fixes Elfmania scoreboard
- DDFSTOP >= 0xe4 effect DOES NOT happen on OCS chipset, only on ECS and AGA... (fixes Sargon History -megademo)
- copper WAIT-wakeup state may not need free cycle, fixes Full Contact but I am not sure if this is correct fix..
- palette wasn't updated properly when entering and exiting the gui in fullscreen 8-bit Picasso96 mode
- new application icon (Michael Battilana)


R6 (19.04.2003)

Beta 6 (final?)

- disabling fast ram (or any expansion ram) and reseting the Amiga doesn't crash anymore
- do not reset when selected CPU is 68000 + compatible or cycle-exact and when program counter
  goes to no man's land (fixes demo Purple by Warfalcons, uses very bad and tricky protection..)
- right CTRL can be used to reset Amiga (RCTRL + INSERT + HOME or RCTRL + Windows keys)
- 68020+ word moves from non-word aligned custom registers fixed (for example move.w $dff005,d0 uuargh..)
  (fixes 4k AGA intro, Fuck the Pc! by Anorganic/Promise!) 
- DDFSTOP >= 0xe4 effect also happens on OCS and ECS chipsets, don't know why I missed that..
  (fixes Wind It Up Megamix 93)
- added DirectX 8 test
- full DIWHIGH save/restore support added
- OCS Agnus ignores DDFSTRT/DDFSTOP bit 1, this fixes Eliminator/Double Dragon 2 properly
  without stupid hacks. (Yes, both games are OCS only, tested on OCS and ECS A500 and A1000)
- default chipset changed to ECS Agnus and selecting >0.5M chip ram automatically enables ECS Agnus
  more compatible and less (hopefully..) complaints about programs that suddenly fail under OCS chipset..

Beta 5

- fixed stupid ASPI bug (bug introduced in B4)
- fixed ce-mode blitter freeze in Picasso96 modes
- fixed crash in Picasso96 mode if OpenGL was enabled (I think so, it didn't crash here..)
- pause-mode (END+PAUSE) fixed (bug introduced in B4)
- simplified and improved disk wordsync and indexsync emulation (fixes Quadlite's "El Egg Tronic Quarts" -slideshow)
- CIA-A LED and OVL bit fix (wasn't proper enough last time..)
- input-tab disable-checkbox implemented, unticked = selected input device is disabled completely
- added Amiga joystick port swap button to input-tab and other input fixes
- AGA dualplayfield color fix, this confirms that BPLCON4 is used normally in DPF mode
  (fixes Tube Warriors bottom of screen, one wrong colored horizontal line still remains)
- 9-bit mode serial port hack implemented. PC hardware don't support 9-bit mode (1 start, 9 data and 1 stop bits)
  but this hack transparently doubles the baud rate and sends/receives two characters when using 9-bit mode.
  Only works if two PCs running WinUAE are connected, PC - Amiga connection naturally can't work.
  Serial linked games should now work (Stunt Car Racer and Lotus 2 tested and confirmed working)
- added support for weird AGA only -feature, if DDFSTOP is >= 0xe4 (= can't be never reached), display DMA
  always starts at 0x18 (DDFSTRT is ignored). This also confirms that position 0x18 is first possible bitplane
  DMA slot. (fixes CCCP-demo and Hellfire cractro graphics garbage)
- ECS/AGA SPRxCTL bits 5 and 6 emulated (vertical start and stop bit 9) (fixes The Dark Demon - Burning Spears demo)
- chipset type can be changed on the fly

Beta 4

- blitter slowdown code fix
- CD32 pad buttons work properly again
- CPU idle checkbox replaced with a slider (was already in B3 but forgot to include changelog entry)
  note that slider works now differently than in B3:
  Slider fully left = disabled, every step to right increases the number of idle-calls. Quick way to find
  good position: boot to WB, move slider right step by step until FPS drops below 50fps then move the
  slider back left two steps. (setting depends on host CPU speed, there is no good default value, yet)
- CPU idle is always disabled in A500-speed mode (only caused trouble)
- increased the size of DirectInput buffers, no more lost input events when moving mouse very quickly
  and/or using high mouse refreshrates.
- copper SKIP-instruction fix (fixes TEK's Rampage -demo partially, later part still crashes)
- uncompressed statefiles can be created by selecting "uncompressed" from "save as type"-select box
- CIA TOD fix (ALRM-interrupt is disabled when TOD is stopped, fixes Entity, which by the way has
  very buggy level 2 interrupt handler..)
- fixed bsdsocket bug that caused hangups when transferring ftp data with diropus (Stephan Riedelbeck)

Beta 3

- AGA BRDBLANK-bit partially supported. Fixes Aladdin AGA. NOTE: running utilities
  that toggle BRDBLANK-bit doesn't update top and bottom border correctly yet.
- better (?) Pentium 4 JIT fixes merged from latest BasiliskII JIT (Bernd Roesch)
- added PAL and NTSC -strings to 50/100 and 60/120 vsync frequencies
- random sound popping fixed (workaround was to enter and exit the GUI)
- fixed freezing if RDTSC's contents suddenly jumped very far, this usually happens
  when returning from hibernate-mode or waiting for a long time in GUI before returning.
  (Bernd Roesch & me)
- more display updates, fixes Wild Streets (and hopefully doesn't break anything..)
- fixed bug in CDTV battery backed RAM emulation (newer CDTV extended ROMs don't freeze anymore)
- turbo-floppy mode supports writing (earlier versions only "turboed" reading)
- fixed writing to multiple floppies simultaneously
  (for example SuperDuper with multiple destination drives selected)
- proper CIA OVL bit emulation (fixes very tricky CAPS Double Dragon 2 protection code)

Beta 2

- more audio tweaks, Liverpool works again
- implemented Picasso96 RAM state file support, added "hooks" for saving/restoring full state
- ADKCON UARTBRK-bit really works now (was commented out in beta 1)
- display emulation update, fixes Eliminator and Double Dragon 2 graphics corruption.
- major disk emulation bug fixed, could cause frozen write operation and disk corruption..
- compressed statefile support. Statefile's RAM contents are automatically compressed when saving.
  also added support for loading (g)zipped statefiles.
- GPF bug fixed when program counter was pointing to random address in 32-bit space in 24-bit mode
  Fixes "more compatible"-mode only, non-compatible still crashes (not easy to fix without
  performance problems or big changes), ce-mode already worked without crashing.
- fixed bug in saveimage-support, compressed disk images can now be write-enabled.
- implemented very simple code that approximates the number of cycles that bitplane DMA steals from the blitter.
  Now it is possible to run some games/demos without graphics glitches in non-cycle exact mode
  (for example PP Hammer and Spindizzy Worlds)
- screenshots are saved to <winuae directory>\ScreenShots -directory
- more CIA serial port emulation updates
- fixed crash when creating empty CD32 NVRAM image file

Beta 1

- input configuration autofire settings weren't saved properly
- Terrorpods background graphics fixed
  (Game writes to BLTCON1, BLTAFWM and BLTALWM after writing to BLTSIZE..)
- disable Windows screensaver when WinUAE is active and GUI is not visible
- disable middle mouse button events when "Middle Mouse-Button -> ALT-TAB" is enabled.
  (caused stuck middle mouse button because release event never arrived..)
- fixed crash when zlib.dll was missing and (g)zipped image was selected
- changing floppy image and clicking "Reset Amiga"-button booted from old image
- added hackish support for AGA only feature that allows sprites outside display window,
  fixes Banshee AGA scoreboard and AB3D background graphics, will cause small (?)
  performance loss only when program uses this feature.
- fixed ancient blitter bug, writing to address 0 was ignored. Fixes CAPS Guy Spy and Dragon's Lair.
- small "delayoffset" fix, fixes Skeleton Krew's jumpy scrolling
- floppies-tab floppy drive type/disable/enabled state select boxes didn't update internal state correctly
- DSKREADY-signal fix. DSKREADY is only low when motor is running full speed and disk is in drive.
  (confirmed with my real A1200 and 2 external drives, drive always turns motor off if floppy is ejected)
  Pango (and probably others too) use this signal to detect disk changes..
- another audio bug fix, caused missing samples/noise with some music players
- partially rewritten serial code, emulated Amiga's DTR,RTS,CD,CTS and DSR lines are
  directly "connected" to PC serial port pins, ADKCON UARTBRK-bit supported, SERDATR status bits
  and serial interrupts are (nearly) properly timed. Configurable hardware CTS/RTS handshaking.
  Of course PC hardware have some limitations: DTR and RTS are output only and
  CD, CTS and DSR are input only. WARNING: may not be 100% bug free yet..

R5: (28.02.2003)

Beta 8 (final?)

- GUI problems in fullscreen mode fixed
- audio bug fixed, fixes Impossible Mission II
- another last minute change: (I really can't stop adding new features..)
  added HDF filesystem selection GUI. Simply select path to Amiga
  filesystem driver (FastFileSystem from WB1.3:L when booting HDF's
  under KS 1.3, SmartFileSystem if you want to boot SFS formatted HDF
  etc..) No more playing with roms-directory and hexadecimal names.

Beta 7 (Release candidate, expected release date 27-28/2):

- Murder/Crack Down audio hack-fix removed. (not needed anymore).
  This must mean my audio emulation updates are correct :)
  Fixes Terrorpods.
- extended adf2 support fix (loading of non-RAW tracks failed)
- implemented input-tab GUI support for 1-4 input events/input source
- Windows 9x crash fixed
- reverted back to beta 5 serial port code, there is no time to
  fix all bugs now in new code. Later..

Beta 6:

- audio quality should be "perfect" again
- sound-"resync" code re-enabled, vsync should be 100% smooth again
  (was accidentally disabled in beta 5)
- disabled floppy drive's motor state is cleared when restoring state
  (no more disabled drives and green leds)
- improved fake-RDB-filesystem loader, it is now possible to autoboot/mount
  custom filesystem formatted regular HDF-files. (SFS, PFS etc..)
  Requires filesystem driver in WinUAE's roms-directory, named filesystem's
  "dostype in hexadecimal.fs". For example SFS's dostype is 0x53465300, file must
  be named 53465300.fs (I know, not very logical but that was too easy to implement..)
- some serial port compatibility "fixes", serial port support may not work...

Beta 5:

- sound quality fixed (I think so..)
- removed debug code that disabled "fast copper"
- enabled very experimental 4 channel DirectSound audio code.
  Amiga's 4 separate audio channels are directly fed to DirectSound
  instead of using UAE's software mixing.
  NOTE: currently 4+ speaker systems get strange results: each Amiga
  channel goes to separate speaker.. (1 goes to front left, 2 goes
  to front right, 3 goes to rear left and 4 goes to rear right..)
  Not tested with 2 speaker systems..
  Enable with "-dsaudiomix" -command line parameter.
  I'll try to fix the speaker problem if this is useful feature (= increases
  performance noticeably compared to software mixing)
- sound interpolation-checkbox fixed and added support for both modes
  (btw, are interpolation modes broken or why do they sound so bad?)
- Amiga program p96refresh let you choose higher mousepointer refreshrates in P96
  p96refresh <frequency 50-200> (Bernd Roesch)
- native interface added to allow executing windows DLL from 68k side (Bernd Roesch)

Beta 4:

- fixed Competitor PC joystick interface compatibility problem
- fixed CAPS image crash when reading non-existing tracks
- track >79 compatibility fix (Pinball Hazard)
- added OS version to winuaebootlog.txt
- floppy speed slider GUI update fix
- copper COPJMP fix (CAPS Wreckers)
- audio updates and hack that fixes Murder, Crack Down and Liverpool
  AUDxDAT should now work correctly
  (rewrote audio state machine emulation. Yeah, I know I shouldn't do
  these kind of near-last minute changes but... Complain loudly if sound
  works badly)
- keyboard led update, update led state only max once/frame,
  only change selected leds' state
- resetting or reinserting disk image didn't always release old image
- changing floppy drive type or enabling/disabling floppy drives
  works properly when emulation is active

Beta 3:

- OpenGL <15 bit depth check should only be done when using fullscreen mode
- more CIA keyboard emulation fixes (CAPS R101)
- CPU status register emulation fix, bits 14 (T0) and 12 (M) are 68020+ bits
  and must always be zeroed in 68000 mode. (CAPS Toki copy protection code)
- new extended adf2's contains free space for 83 tracks (was 80)
- added disk write-protection support GUI. moved drive disable-checkboxes to
  drive-type box. This is quite complex internally..
  - images that support writing (regular and ext2 adf)
    - checked = read-only flag set
    - unchecked = read-only flag removed
  - read-only images (caps,fdi,ext adf,compressed images):
    - checked:
      - save-image exists and is not empty: save-image's read-only flag is set
      - save-image exists and is still empty: delete save image
      - no save-image: do nothing
    - unchecked:
      - save-image exists: remove read-only flag
      - no save-image: create empty saveimage
  - save images are always created in <winuae root>/SaveImages -directory
    (because selected "parent" image may be located in read-only media)
  - changing writeprotection state causes automatic disk re-insert
    (eject,2s delay,insert)
- state files are now saved to <winuae root>/SaveStates (was Configurations..)
- keyboard LED GUI (misc-page)
- AGA SHRES sprite bug fix (fixes Super Skidmarks hires-mode cars)
- restoring 68020+ state and CPU speed is set to A500 -> change to fastest possible
- filter END+<any key> key releases

Beta 2.1:

- non-blocksize aligned HDFs work again
- keyboard led code improved and fixed
  configuration file line is now: "keyboard_leds=xxx:yyy,xxx:yyy,xxx:yyy"
  where xxx = "capslock", "numlock" or "scrolllock" and
  yyy = df0,df1,df2,df3,power,hd or cd
  (example: "keyboard_leds=scrolllock:power,capslock:df0")

Beta 2:

- renamed save-images to "<name of original image>_save.adf", original extension is removed
  (for example: Example.ipf -> Example_save.adf) Makes names more logical when this feature
  is used with regular adf-files.
- hardfile/harddrive cache bug fix (SFS formatted hardfiles/harddrives work again)
- Action Replay improvements (Mark Cox)
- it wasn't possible to set input-tab's default mappings to none, fixed
- fixed too small config file description buffer in WinUAE GUI code
- configurable keyboard leds (DF0,DF1,DF2,DF3,POWER,HD and CD)
  No GUI yet. Add "keyboard_leds=xxx,xxx,xx" to config file.
  (num lock, caps lock, scroll lock) xxx = none,DF0,DF1 etc..
  Need Windows9x testing (W9x uses very different way of controlling leds than W2K/XP)
- primary sound buffer option removed and disabled. It is not needed anymore and usually
  only caused strange slowdown problems.
- DirectInput devices were allocated multiple times and never freed
- middle mousebutton in fullscreen mode minimizes WinUAE if
  "Middle-Mouse-Button -> ALT-TAB" is ticked.
- OpenGL-mode is disabled if display depth is lower than 15
- Because Windows DDK can't be downloaded anymore from microsoft.com, I added define to
  sysconfig.h (WINDDK) that can be used to disable compilation of features that need
  DDK includes (Windows 2K/XP CDROM, harddrive support and keyboard leds)
- improved programmable horizontal and vertical timing support. Setting 31KHz native
  mode under Picasso96 display modes (for example writing "setenv picasso96/amigavideo 31khz")
  works mostly but audio isn't too good yet..
- yet another Pentium4 JIT fix, Pagestream crashes without it (Bernd Roesch)


Beta 1:

- restoring state with sound disabled caused crash if state was saved with sound, fixed
- fixed mouse problems in Space Crusade, Billy the Kid and more..
- another fast ram state restore fix
- writing to ext2 images was unstable, fixed
- FPU state save support
- floppy drives' disk change flag wasn't reset when state was restored, fixed
- "save disk image"-support. All writes to images that don't support writing go to separate
  extended adf2-image and reads from already written tracks come from ext2-image instead of
  "main" image. This is especially needed by some future CAPS-images. (There are games that
  want to write to the original disk, for example Pinball Dreams highscores but we can't and
  don't want to modify original images)
  "save image" must be currently created manually by clicking "create custom image" (disk-tab),
  image's name must be <name of original image>.adf (for example, Example.ipf -> Example.ipf.adf)
  Image is write-enabled only if save-image exists and is not read-only.
  Any suggestions for GUI?
- 68000 cpu returns the contents of prefetch register when reading from address that does
  not exist. (for example reads from 0x200000 without real fast ram)
- CIA serial port emulation updates. Fixes Back to the Future 2's keyboard freeze.
  (fixes probably other games' keyboard problems too)
- another "last_custom_value"-update, fixes more slowram detection crashes (Commando etc..)
- another bsdsocket emulation fix (Stephen Riedelbeck)
- added configurable device name and boot priority for volumes and hardfiles
- "more compatible" 68000-mode accidentally used some cycle-exact-only functions
- CD32 media change detection fixed (only worked in 0821R1..)
- CD32 pads are now enabled even in non-cd32 mode if configured in input-tab


---
R4

Beta 3:

- switching between windowed and fullscreen disabled sound
  (does not happen with some sound drivers), fixed
- Caps lock fixed (again..)
- build-in DMS support. Will be removed if someone complains..
  (Xdms.exe is really too limited..)
- CTRL-AMIGA-AMIGA-ALT hard-reset works again
- Debugger's S-command used non-binary mode to save files, fixed
- DENISEID-register last_custom fix (fixes Alien Breed - Tower Assault)
- added support for 1.5MB bogoRAM expansion
- another ACTION_RENAME-bug fixed. Rename created new unneeded
  __uaefsdb-entry if only filename's case changed
  (for example: "rename file.txt file.TXT")

Beta 2:

- sound timing always defaulted back to PAL when WinUAE lost or gained focus, fixed.
- Voyage by Razor1991 really works but only randomly
  (requires cycle-exact mode and might need multiple tries, more improved ce-mode needed..)
- CAPS-format support added.
  Needs CAPSImg.dll from CAPS. Not yet available for public.
  Send your questions about Caps directly to http://www.caps-project.org/
  I don't answer any Caps-specific questions.
- use QueryPerformanceCounter() instead of RDTSC if CPU throttling is detected.
  Fixes slowdown problems on laptops, also old processors without RDTSC should run WinUAE again
  without crashing.
- ALT-TAB keyboard fix
- joystick layout B fire fixed (broke in B1)
- joystick configuration bug fix (sometimes joystick didn't work..)
- Picasso96 framebuffer access speedup (Bernd Roesch)

Beta 1:

- improved FPS-counter, added FPS-counter led.
- added blitter fill-mode cycle diagram. Enabling fill mode adds DMA channel C to
  cycle diagram even if it is disabled in BLTCON0. Fixes "Reflect - Sound Vision"
- Catweasel MK3 Amiga keyboard and joystick ports support and Z2-board emulation implemented
- emulate serial port transmit interrupts even if serial port is disabled
  I don't think we can expect users to enable serial emulation to run some games
  that don't even have serial-link option. (Dragon's Lair 2, Moonwalker etc..)
- removed exclusive mouse-mode, mouse handling should be now more compatible.
- faster Picasso96 color fades (Bernd Roesch)
- CD-led is now lit when CD32 audio track is playing
- RDB filesystem loader compatibility fix, SmartFileSystem 1.58 doesn't crash anymore
- filesystem: _UAEFSDB.___ handling fixes, also deletes "ghost"-entries automatically
  (files/directories that are deleted outside of emulation)
- filesystem: ACTION_RENAME fixes. Old name's opened locks and filehandles are transferred
  to new name, filehandles are temporarily closed during rename (under AmigaDOS it is
  possible to rename files that are open) Fixed some "ghost"-UAEFSDB entry-bugs.
- filesystem: added notification support (ACTION_ADD_NOTIFY, ACTION_REMOVE_NOTIFY)
- filesystem: added code that updates parent directory's modification time when file is
  created, written, deleted or renamed. (NTFS does all except rename, FAT apparently never
  updates parent directory's modification time)
  Fixes Directory Opus and DosControl automatic directory list refresh when using FAT
- log messages that arrive before emulation starts are written to winuaebootlog.txt
- uaescsi.device reset crash fixed (happened only under Win9x)
- custom chip "last_custom_value"-update. Fixes Lotus 3 (and probably some other programs')
  slow ram detection.
- CIA and MOVEM M->R cycle usage fixes (Voyage - Razor1991 works now, first boot only...)
- allocate bigger MIDI sysex buffer to prevent overflows (Bernd Roesch)
- disabled mostly useless JIT-log messages (can be enabled by defining JIT_DEBUG and recompiling)
- PAUSE-key = pause emulation. PAUSE+END = full speed emulation (sound is turned off)

Mouse code is mix between old and new WinUAE mouse code. It probably have some bugs..

Filesystem compatibility should be much better now. Could someone test programs that have refused
to install/run under older UAE filesystem versions?


---

RC:

- floppy drive leds light correctly (stupid bug)
- small CIA fix (reading $BFE001 returns correct power led state)
- Input-tab keyboard configuration works again (why didn't nobody notice?)

Beta 3:

- all hardfiles/harddrives described in default.uae were never freed making them unavailable
  if other configuration was loaded and it used same hardfiles as default.uae. fixed.
- mouse counter overflow limit works again (moving mouse very fast made mouse jump around under
  KS 1.3 and some mouse controlled games)
- Amithlon partition detection failed if drive had >6 partitions. fixed.
  (Partition table buffer was too small...)
- non-Amiga formatted or non-empty harddrive safety test can be disabled with
  "-disableharddrivesafetytest" command-line parameter. WinUAE also shows warning
  messages if "dangerous" harddrives are detected and test is disabled

Beta 2:

- A500-speed slowdown problems fixed (*)
- "The selected screen mode can't be displayed in a window, because.." now correctly
  forces fullscreen mode instead of repeating the message forever..
- initial Amiga viewport position fixed

(*) My new Asus A7N8X Deluxe Gold (nForce2) -mainboard arrived today and suprise, suprise,
WinUAE's fps decreased to about 40fps. I finally managed to debug this problem!
It appears calling timeBeginPeriod() and timeEndPeriod() too many times/frame
caused big slowdown. I still don't understand why it only affects some systems..
(probably it depends on drivers because I didn't reinstall OS)

Beta 1b:

- removed debugging code that disabled RDB custom filesystem

Beta 1:

- Ports-tab crash fixed (printer detection bug)
- some joysticks had joystick axis in wrong order (for example Y before X etc..)
- only first joystick worked in input-tab
- plus other joystick bugs fixed
- WinUAE window position in registry is now correct
- hard drive configuration save fix (some harddrive ID's had trailing spaces)
- fixed stuck keys when switching between WinUAE and Windows
- sprite fix (flashing garbage in Pinball Dreams)
- added Harddisk and CD-leds that flash during HD/CD access
- thread priority tweaks
- Windows 95 setupapi.dll error fixed

R2:

Beta 7:

- screenshot changes, PrintScreen -> Windows clipboard
  (now works even in overlay-mode) and PrintScreen + END
  -> screenshot file (was F11)
- more disk emulation updates ("The Deep" works again)
- bsdsocket changes. Fixes Win98 dialing, TCP-device
  and Amygate (Stephan Riedelbeck)

Beta 6:

- primary sound buffer checkbox can be changed on the fly
- floppy buffer overflow fixed
- RDB filesystem bug fix
  caused memory corruption if RDB contained non-automountable partition(s)
- ALT-TAB didn't always release mouse capture
- DirectInput device enumeration fixed
- blitter nasty-mode bug fixed (Obliterator and TerrorPods intro graphics corruption)
- Amiga Catweasel ZorroII-board emulation. (ISA-Catweasel supported)
  Device is detected but reading is unreliable due to timing problems either in
  isacatweasel.device or timer.device in JIT mode. No GUI config, to enable emulation
  add "catweasel_io=xxx" to config file. WinIo.dll, WinIo.sys (2K/XP) and
  WinIo.VXD (W9x) from http://www.internals.com/utilities/winio.zip required.
  Download Amiga driver from http://www.jschoenfeld.de/ support page
  (ISACatweasel.device for Amithlon)
  New Catweasel MK3 (PCI-version) support will be implemented in future.
  Experimental. Bug reports are probably ignored because this won't be part of
  "official" 0.8.22R2 feature list..
- network printers are listed in ports-tab
- tries to prevent frozen mouse if WinUAE crashes
- Kickstart replacement is now correctly enabled if kick rom was not selected
- disk emulation updates
  fixes for Megalomania, Knightmare, Supaplex etc.. ultra slow loading speed,
  more compatible with some copy protections
- Action Replay support fixed

Beta 5:

- ignore mouse events when WinUAE is not in focus
- disk emulation track length/motor speed fix (Istvn Fabian)
- filesystem "ghost"-file fix
  (but we still have one bug left in ACTION_RENAME that isn't so easy to fix)
- F10 and ALT-keys don't freeze the emulation anymore
- Capital Punishment graphics fix
- Picasso96 COMP-drawing mode don't work correctly in >8bit modes, added
  workaround. (found by Bernd Roesch)
- fixed buggy gfx_opengl_mode and gfx_opengl_bits -configuration entry handling
  (caused duplicate entries)

Beta 4:

- mouse fixes and speed multiplier added to input-tab (100=1x,200=2x,50=1/2x etc..)
- caps lock fixed
- cpu idle changes (still need much better algorithm, later..)
- replaced Sleep() with multimedia timers (much better timer accurary)
  this fix might improve sound with small buffer sizes
- switch from fullscreen/no-vsync to vsync crash fixed (this was a very old bug)
- another old config file compatibility fix

Beta 3:

- keyboard layout "B" firebutton fixed
- startup "detect 16-bit" crash fixed
- copper cycle diagram fix (Chaos Engine AGA/CD32 horizontal line)
- screenshot button was always disabled

Beta 2:

- GUI's hardfile/harddrive size fixed (fractional part was always zero)
- "Use Primary DirectSound buffer"-checkbox fixed
- input-tab's joystick/mouse/keyboard axis/button/key names are now queried from DirectInput
- all keyboard's special keys are also configurable in input-tab
- DirectInput fixes (joysticks work etc..)
- direct harddrive access fixed, >512 byte reads/writes are now working properly.
  (caused "not a dos disk" errors if filesystem block size was > 512)
- added 1024 and 2048 physical blocksize support to direct harddrive access code
- RDB code renames duplicate device names (DH0: -> DH0_0: etc..)
- german keyboard layout "hack" fixed (Bernd Roesch)
- improved keyboard configuration, old keyboard configs are not compatible anymore
- "Pentium 4 JIT"-fix enabled in release build
- state load fixes (replacing KS don't clear chip RAM anymore, another CPU type fix)
  Loading 68020/AGA states files with A500 config should now replace configuration
  correctly (finally..)

Beta 1.1:

- >4G hardfiles really work now
- cpu idle fixed

Beta 1:

- disk emulation fix (High density floppy images in non-"turbo" mode were read too slowly causing
  read errors)
- removed bad disk emulation optimization (froze some custom loaders)
- implemented disk drive type configuration. I had to do this because it is not possible
  to emulate real DD and HD drives 100% correctly automatically and I also wanted to add
  ancient&useless 5.25 drive (A1010) support too :)
- automatically disable "turbo"-floppy speed if using non-standard ADF images
- implemented Kickstart 1.3 hardfile support and some RDB filesystem compatibility bug fixes
  (regular KS1.3 hardfile autoboot/mount requires FastFileSystem from WB1.3:L in roms-directory)
- hardfile code rewritten with full 64-bit support ("unlimited" size)
  supports both TD64 and NSD -style 64-bit access.
  Windows 2000 or XP and NTFS filesystem required (Both W9x and FAT32 are
  limited to max 2G files)
  WARNING: some Amiga disk utilities fail to understand >2G partitions and could
  corrupt big hardfiles! OS3.5+ recommended!
  Only drives that don't contain recognised PC partition table and are either empty or
  contain RDB are available in selection dialog (safety feature)
  Amithlon partition support (partition type 0x76) implemented. NOT TESTED YET!
  WARNING: Bugs could cause lost data! Every read and write access to Amithlon partition
  is tested against partition bounds but better safe than sorry..
- uaehf.device is now threaded (read/write requests are run in background)
- fixed uaehf.device crash with older HDToolBox versions
- removed sectors, surfaces and reserved from harddisk tab
  (IMHO they only need to be in hardfile configuration dialog)
- added missing CPU idle configuration entry
- CPU idle code changes
- added cycle exact configuration entry
- increased directory filesystem emulation cache
  (workaround to randomly disappearing flags/comments)
- CPU model is restored correctly when restoring save state file
- DirectInput keyboard, mouse and joystick interface
  - shift-keys don't get stuck anymore in Pinball Dreams etc..
  - Uses DirectInput's MS supported way of disabling all special keys, only ALT-TAB and
    CTRL-ALT-DEL are left enabled.
  - Uses DirectInput exclusive mouse mode to hide Windows mouse pointer instead of
    old version's "interesting" hack...
  - WARNING: expect to find bugs
  - NOTE: mouse speed might be different because DirectInput reads directly from
    mouse driver. (no acceleration etc..)
- mouse input-configuration changed (separated horiz and vertical axis and mouse
  wheel is now third axis)
- "disable Windows keys"-checkbox removed. Windows keys are now always disabled.
  (I added disable checkbox because wkeykill.dll was unsupported hack and could have
  caused problems in some situations) Complain if there is need to not disable
  Windows keys.
- some old config file compatibility fixes
- "compatible" cpu mode checkbox was ignored
  (This was the reason why 0822R1 needed cycle-exact mode to run C64 tune disk)
- 68000 RESET-instruction's prefetch emulation fixed
- CIA overlay-bit fix (regs.pc_p and regs.pc_oldp wasn't updated)
- added Kickstart ROM path to state files (only used when restoring if file exists)

0.8.22R1:

Beta 5:

- RDB custom filesystem fixes
- make "regular" hardfiles invisible to HDToolbox
- fix CD32 pad emulation in compatibility mode

Beta 4:

- small sound changes: AHI sound disabled when resetting the Amiga, DirectSound is freed
  when WinUAE is minimized and "Disable sound output" is ticked.
- input-tab autofire rate fixed
- fixed fast memory state save bug
- joystick compatibility mode fixes
- another uaescsi.device compatibility fix

Beta 3:

- AVIOutput fix (editing parameters didn't work until emulation was started)
- centering works again (broke in beta 2)
- more uaescsi.device compatibility fixes (all Amiga CD filesystems should now work properly)
- CD32 pad emulation fixes
- fixed crash when "ejecting" broken zipped adf-files
- bsdsocket fixes (Stephan Riedelbeck)
- exception 3 handling fixed (was broken by JIT fix ages ago..)
- improved RDB filesystem relocator (fixes PFS3 and others)
- screenshot key shortcut mapped to F11
- multiple sound card support (original GUI code by Brian King)
- fixed programs that use POTxDAT to read second fire button (was broken ages ago)

Beta 2:

- UAE 0.8.22 merge, bumped version number (most changes were already included in R4)
- switching cycle-exact off does not freeze the emulator anymore (but Amiga still freezes..)
- Action Replay 1 support (breakpoints don't work)
- writing to hardfiles work again
- CPU emulator fix: CHK-instruction's exception return address was wrong (Days of Thunder)
- AVIOutput update (Sane)
- floppy speed slider GUI fixed
- disk emulation initialization fix (fixes A1000 boot failure in non-"turbo" mode)
- CPU idle checkbox works after emulation has been started
- keyboard fix (some key presses were missed when pressing multiple keys)
- sound changes: (yet again...)
  - vsync enabled and/or JIT enabled: adjustment active (like older versions)
  - vsync disabled and JIT disabled: UAE 0.8.22 sound timing (adjustment disabled)
  (JIT will have HUGE slowdown and vsync skips if UAE 0.8.22-style timing is enabled)
  - uses DirectSound primary buffer if possible (SDL does this too)
  - depending on sound card, small buffers (1 and 2) might work very badly..
- uaehf.device scsi emulator fixes
- changed "create hardfile"-dialog's hardfile size to megabytes and added 2GB limit
  (limit will be removed after uaehf.device supports 64-bit addressing)
- uaescsi.device reboot crash fixed
- full RDB harddisk image support (automount, custom filesystems etc..)

Beta 1: (too many changes, expect breakage..)

- unoptimized near cycle-exact cpu and blitter emulation implemented (checkbox in misc-tab)
  Fixes most programs that expect correct cpu and blitter speed (PP Hammer, many demos etc..)
  WARNING: requires at least 50%+ more cpu power than "regular" mode.
  Athlon XP/Pentium IV + DDR/RAMBUS RAM highly recommended!
  WARNING2: Frameskip must be set to 1
  WARNING3: very experimental, timing is quite far from perfection
  Complain loudly if "regular" mode is slower. (It shouldn't be but you never know..)
- yet another 68000 prefetch emulation rewrite (fixes "100 most remembered C64 games" and more..)
- OpenGL scanline brightness slider added
- yet another disk emulation update
  (more compatible, stupid extended adf bug fixed that caused format/verify errors)
- interlace mode vsync fixed (no more 2x speed)
- added support for compressed kickstart rom-images
- encrypted A1000 boot rom support added
- 64kb A1000 boot rom supported (A1000 boot rom size is really 64kb even if only first 8kb is used..)
- 256kb chip RAM support added (first A1000s come with 256kb chip RAM as standard, expandable to 512kb)
- dms files inside zip -crash fixed
  (xdms.exe that does not add .dms extension to source file's name needed for correct decompression support)
- fixed com-port warning (start emulation, press F12, select input-tab)
- sprite-playfield collision fix (fixes Inferior but may break something else.. Testing needed!)
- display garbage fix (Nightbreed Interactive Movie, some demos)
- input device support updates
  defaults added to mouse and joysticks, mouse didn't always work correctly,
  autofire works now properly, supports max 4 input targets/input source
  (currently only available by manually editing configuration files,
  example: input.1.mouse.0.button.0=JOY1_FIRE_BUTTON.0,JOY2_FIRE_BUTTON.0)
- another experimental cpu idle hack (detects when Kickstart executes STOP-instruction)
  lowers host CPU usage near zero when emulated system is idle.
- added cpu idle checkbox to GUI CPU-page
- new AHI code and driver (Bernd Roesch)
- Amiga <> Windows clipboard support, see winuaeclip.txt for more information (Bernd Roesch)
- added device io (CMD_READ, CMD_CHANGESTATE etc..) support to uaescsi.device
  no need to enable direct-scsi anymore, also media change detection
  (ADDCHANGEINT/REMCHANGEINT) is emulated properly. This means uaescsi.device emulation should
  now work properly with all available cd file systems without special mountlist flags.
- fixed bug in state save restore code, sometimes restored floppy drive track was incorrect
- added wkeykill.dll support. Kills all normal Windows key combinations (except some keys don't
  work properly on WXP, for example LWin+L, hopefully this can be fixed later..)
  Unfortunately it is not possible to integrate Windows key kill code to WinUAE because it seems
  it is only possible to kill Windows key events properly from a separate dll..
- Amiga-"viewport" is now centered correctly, no more clipped window borders
- FPU emulator's precision was poor, fixed (cause: wrong compiler optimization parameters)
- filesystem bug fix (hopefully fixes bug that causes random files appearing as directories)
- on the fly switching between OpenGL and DirectDraw mode
- on the fly switching between vsync and non-vsync mode
- DirectSound sound code is back with auto-adjust. Better or worse than old code?
  (I replaced SDL audio because it is now confirmed that SDL audio has strange lag
  problems with some systems. I might include both, depends on test results..)
- audio emulation fix (Mission Elevator)
  also some AUDxDAT fixes (fixes random CD32 boot tune noise)
- build-in screenshot function (original code by Sane)
  supports all modes: DirectDraw, DirectDraw Overlay, OpenGL and Picasso96
  current shortcut key: END+F6 (Suggestions?)
- set active WinUAE process priority level higher, improves smoothness
  makes Windows' responsiveness worse but I hope it isn't too bad..
- decreased trackdisplay leds' brightness slightly
- writing to kickstart rom memory area crashed the system if JIT was enabled
- floppy speed slider (I know I shouldn't put it back but I got too many requests..)
- second filesystem bug fix: situations where file read length was very big were not handled correctly
- third filesystem bug fix: CON.something, AUX.something etc. are not valid Windows filenames
- added simple "scsi emulator" to uaehf.device. It is now possible to edit full harddisk images with hdtoolbox
  ("hdtoolbox uaehf.device". Sectors, surfaces and reserved can be set to zero)
  not very useful feature because booting/automounting does not work yet...

- CPU exception 3 fix (Shinobi)
- disk updates (more correct DSKRDY/floppy device ID handling) (S.T.A.G)
- *.zip added to disk image selector
- Caps Lock and misc keyboard fixes (new input device mode only)
- return random bits if program is trying to read track past image's end (Typhoon Thompson)
- yet another sprite emulation rewrite. Report immediately if you notice missing/flashing/corrupt etc sprites!

- keyboard -> Amiga joystick/mouse/keyboard configuration implemented (US keyboard layout only)
- another copper skip fix (fixes Rainbow Islands)
- CPU idle patch
- MIDI fixes (Bernd Roesch, Alfred J. Faust)

- better Superfrog/Exile etc.. border fix (old version caused display problems with some demos)
- new input device configuration is finally working
  TODO:
  - more intuitive GUI (Help needed)
  - add international key names
  - implement multiple mouse support
    Unfortunately it seems DirectInput don't support multiple mouse on W2K/XP.
    http://www.angelfire.com/retro/u_rebelscum/faqs.html#win2000limit
    (confirmed with two USB mouse on WXP)
  - PC keyboard -> Amiga mouse/joystick/keyboard mapping editor
- OpenGL tweaks (scaling changed, 0,0,0,0 = centered screen. Added default-button)
- misc-tab changes (disabled state save-button if emulator is not started, reset and quit-buttons are always visible)
- GUI remembers last used property page (tab)
- two executables, one compiled with MSVC 7 (MSVS.net) and the other with MSVC 6.

Beta 3:

- HOME + F5 opens state restore dialog and SHIFT + HOME + F5 opens state save dialog
- experimental OpenGL support
  internal window size is always 752*600 (376*300 if lores is enabled and linedoubling is off)
  image size configuration
  scanline emulation (transparency and size)
  requires 1024 * 1024 or larger supported texture size (won't work with old cards)
- AVIoutput improvements (can be started later, stops when re-entering GUI, vsync-waits ignored)
- Picasso96/native mode switching should be working again (was broken in beta 1 and 2)
- Superfrog, Exile etc.. left border bug fixed

- build-in gzip and zip support (autoselects first adf-image or Amiga executable if zip contains multiple files)
- executable to adf support, just "insert" Amiga executable in to floppy drive
- improved external decompression support (currently only xdms.exe),
  temporary files are loaded back in to memory and deleted immediately after decompression.
- 50/60/100/120Hz frequencies are now always selectable. I think this allows vsync-support with display drivers
  that don't support frequency selection but support custom resolutions (for example with PowerStrip)
- Picasso96 Drawstudio fix (Bernd Roesch)
- removed 8/16-bit sound selection from gui. Sound is now always 16-bit.
- sound adjust slider reimplemented. (fully automatic sound adjust seems to be impossible..)
  sound code is still autoadjusting but with very limited adjustment range
  (allows 100% smooth vsync at least on my pc..)

  adjustment instructions: move slider left until sound doesn't crackle anymore (no more sound buffer underflows)
  adjustment position isn't very important except if you want vsync without random skips.

Beta 1:

- fixed right border garbage (CD32 bootscreens and other programs)
- "16-bit mode detect" does not crash anymore if registry keys are not found
- vsync updates, vsync can be enabled or disabled during the emulation

Beta 1:

- full CD32 emulation
- uaescsi.device Win32 port
- blitter "fix" (fixes Desert Dream freeze and Hostages insta-kill)
- input device rewrite (no config file save/load and gui yet, not very useful now..)
