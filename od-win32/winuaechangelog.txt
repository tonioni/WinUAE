Beta 4:

- statefiles with autoconfigurable (fast and z3fast) memory wasn't
  restored properly
- directory filesystem statefile support.
- Picasso96 statefile support (not very compatible yet)
- HDF statefile support. WARNING: HDF _WILL_ get CORRUPTED if you
  try to restore same HDF statefiles multiple times and there has been
  one or more writes between restores. Read-only will be forced before
  official release.
- JIT slowdown after restore fixed (CPU CACR register instruction cache
  setting syncronized with JIT cache settings)

  Filesystem statefile information:

  Handling of missing files or directories during restore:
  - missing root directory: most likely crashes
  - open file:
  dummy file with exact same name and size will be created (filled
  with zeros) to prevent crashes. Of course application using the
  file most likely fails because it may not contain data it expects
  but at least FS emulation and AmigaDOS is happy..
  - open lock:
  lock is re-created but missing file/directory stays missing. Again,
  filesystem and AmigaDOS is happy. Application may crash or return
  weird errors..
  
  Always check the log first if there are problems.
  
  NOTE: uaescsi, bsdsocket etc.. are not saved. You may be able to
  restore statefile with unsupported "expansion" devices enabled
  without crashing (for example restored uaescsi won't crash the
  emulator but Amiga-side program can get confused.. Tested with
  AmiKit, no crashes but CD0: stops working)
  
  NOTE2: statefile format can and will change in future betas.

  Manual loading of configuration recommended before restoring.


Beta 3:

- CPU/FPU on the fly change fixes
- report 68060 EC/LC ID in PCR register when FPU not enabled,
  68040/60 FPU disabled exception emulated.
- some 68030 MMU instructions had incorrect instruction length
  (no, MMU is NOT emulated but MMU instructions are still processed
  normally instead of reporting illegal instruction because some
  programs expect MMU and most/all 68EC030's don't report exceptions
  either, they simply have MMU that does not work 100%)
- http://aminet.net/util/sys/Mu680x0Libs.lha appears to be free,
  working replacement for 680x0-libraries. 68030 (didn't work in b2),
  68040 and 68060 with or without FPU confirmed working.
- FPU state restore fixed
- added CPU/FPU frequency to state files (not yet really used except
  sets A500 speed if stored statefile was A500-speed config)
- added 68030+ control register statefile support
- 1340b4 "rare divide by zero error..." really fixed..

Beta 2:

- 10x+ performance increase during "decrunching" color effects when
  no filters enabled and bitplanes disabled (background color only)
- console debugger breakpoints sometimes continued immediately
- quickstart "random" selection inside archives should be fixed
- mousehack interrupt do not start multiple times anymore
- all CPU-specific special registers added to debugger
- CPU/FPU configuration rewrite.
  - new FPU options: none/68881/68882/CPU internal
  - 68030 (EC-version, 030-only MMU instructions are simply ignored)
  - proper 68060 with FPU support. See NOTEs below!
  - 68040/68060 without FPU allowed but note that 68060.library does
  not appear to like non-FPU 68060s..
  - no FPU+68000/68010 (technically possible but not worth the trouble)

  68060 NOTES: No working Setpatch and 68060.library = NO FPU.
  68060 has FPU disable bit that all real 68060 accelerators' boot ROM
  set because KS task switching routine do not understand 68060's
  FRESTORE/FSAVE frames. Setpatch+68060.library is the fix.

  Real 68060 is also extremely slow without 68060.library because all
  caches and other speed-up features are not enabled but this is
  completely irrelevant in emulation.

  You can use "C:CPU" command to check CPU/FPU status:
  - Incorrect: "System: 68060 (INST: blahblah"
  - Correct: "System 68060 68882 (INST: blahblah"
  New setpatch (44.38 confirmed) support 68060.library directly, older
  versions need dummy 68040.library (less than 1K in size)
 
  NOTE2: FPU emulation emulates all 6888x instructions, even those that
  were removed from real 68040/060. 

  !!! NOTE3: _EMULATED_ 68040 and 68060 HAVE EQUAL SPEED !!!

  
Beta 1:

- Chip set extra config load/save missed some models (crash when
  saving if using missing models)
- GUI font dynamically switches to "Segoe UI" (Vista) or "Tahoma"
  (XP or 2000). Old font still in resource file to keep compatibility
  with older Windows versions. TODO: new GUI tree icons.
- dynamically modifying resources and resizing dialogs is "fun"...
- finally removed pixel format detection. It has not been needed for
  years..
- merged (and modified) "GUI" debugger by Karsten Bock. WIP.
  F1-F6: switch between different pages
  F1 and F2: two work areas
  F3 and F4: memory viewer
  F5 and F6: disassembler
  F3-F6: alt+cursor up/down/left/right modifies current address
- x closes debugger, xx switches between console and GUI debuggers
- extended debugger 'm' instruction, 'm r<cpu register>' 
- direct harddrive support now works with drives that return empty
  vendor and product id (confirmed: SyQuest removable harddrive)
- log window position and size stored in registry. (Log window first
  appearing in default position before jumping to stored position
  is normal, logging must be initialized before registry handling)
  Windows 2000 or newer only.
- GUI/Main window registry entry names changed, positions will reset
- blitter CE-mode ABC channel combination cycle allocation fixed
- rar archives left "temporary" files around (stupid unrar.dll..)
- added combination of fullscreen and windowed mode. If you have two
  (or more) monitors, load your favorite WB configuration, select
  non-primary monitor and "full-window" mode to both native and RTG,
  also make sure "Magic mouse" is enabled, adjust P96 resolution.
  D3D/OGL filter may also be good idea.
  Result will be near-seamless Windows/Amiga integration :)
- "Magic mouse" didn't work with some system patches, also adjusted
  sensitivity
- tweaked vblank interrupt delay by 1 cycle (game Feud)
- refresh rate switching (PAL/NTSC or by poking VPOSW) improved

1.4.1

Beta 4:

- skip unknown extensions (or files without extension) when scanning
  for known ROMs (faster scan if non-ROM files in ROM directory)
- Picasso96 RAM was incorrectly mapped in non-JIT modes
- paraport parallel port support sets INIT (pin 16) to inactive state
  (called RESET in Amiga parallel port)

Beta 3:

- map POV Hat to joystick up/down and left/right by default
- added master volume (Windows main volume) control input targets
  default: END+CTRL+(numpad - and +, * = mute on/off)
  (without CTRL = WinUAE-only volume control) Also master volume
  mapped by default to "multimedia" vol down/up/mute keys.
- custom input targets editable in GUI now (not very intuitive but
  whole input panel isn't too intuitive. someday..)
- fixed crash when switching from CD32/CDTV mode to A500 mode
- input panel input list can be browsed in "compatibility mode"

Beta 2:

- better bsdsocket threading fix, should finally fix random crashes.
- diskswapper input-panel input targets added (next/prev/insert)
- change input configuration (1-4) input target added
- custom input targets added, experimental, not in GUI yet, need manual
  configuration file editing, syntax:
  <anything>.button.x=<press>,<release>,<secondary press>,<sec. release>
  press/release = key down/up, joystick button down/up
  secondary = toggle-mode (first press uses "press" event, second press
  uses "secondary press", third press is again "press" event etc..)
  format of single event: '"entry=value"'.0 "unlimited" multiple
  entry/value pairs supported: '"entry1=value1" "entry2=value2"'.0
  empty event: NULL.0
  Examples:
  - toggle onscreen leds:
  '"show_leds=false"'.0,NULL.0,'"show_leds=true"'.0
  - refresh rate = 100 while key/button is kept down:
  '"chipset_refreshrate=100"'.0,'"chipset_refreshrate=50"'.0
  NOTES: format can change in future, toggle-mode may be added to regular
  input event mapping system in future version.
  BTW: custom input was implemented ages ago but it was not enabled until
  now... (I forgot it..)
  
Beta 1:

- startup crash fixed if serial port enumeration detected more than
  8 ports. (broke in 140b6 when "compatibility mode" enumeration was
  added) Also increased max amount of supported serial ports
- default ASPI detection selected (possibly non-existing) AdaptecASPI
- Quickstart now automatically selects working SCSI mode (uses setting
  from default.uae if available, if not, selects "best" available)
- 120b1 right border update fixed to work in interlaced modes (Unreal)

1.4.0

Beta 10 (pre-final):

- in some cases dskready signal was set active even if floppy drive
  was empty and motor was running
- yet another undocumented CIA TOD related feature implemented
  TOD does not latch (by reading TODHI) if CRB ALARM-bit is set.
  Fixes Batman the Movie (which worked in older versions only
  by accident..)

Beta 9: (RC 2)

- non-ASPI CDTV CD audio didn't always stop when exiting/reseting
- added dj [<mask>] command to debugger. Enable joystick/mouse
  input logging  
- CDTV quickstart chip ram size set to correct 1M (correct config
  is more important than workaround for one game)
- Fixed another filesystem lock leak in ACTION_FH_FROM_LOCK
  (dos.library/OpenFromLock())
- do not allow unlocking of non-existing locks in filesystem.
  Previously it caused random memory corruption and also triggered
  following (previously unknown) 1.0b2 issue:
  "added workaround for AMOS filesystem emulation incompatibility
  (infinite loop in filesystem code) Reason for freeze unknown,
  proper fix unknown.. (filesystem emulation is confusing..)"
- external drive sound selection GUI didn't work if fdrawcmd.sys
  was not installed

Beta 8: (RC 1)

- uaehf.device unit >=30 crash fixed
- CDTV CD audio will be stopped when exiting/reseting
- correct CDTV CD number of tracks returned in ASPI-mode
- re-added and fixed special case handling for 68k reset-instruction
  when more compatible CPU setting is not enabled
- filesystem ACTION_COPY_DIR_FH packet memory (lock) leak fixed

Beta 7: (possible bug fixes and small tweaks left)

- Picasso96 graphics problems really fixed
- adjusting GUI sound settings on the fly does not anymore cause
  random sound issues after returning back to emulation (like
  missing channel(s) for few moments etc..)
- Action Replay 1, ver 1.0 added to ROM scanner identication list

Beta 6:

- FPU emulation floating point to integer conversion fixed, previously
  for example float -> byte conversion simply truncated to byte instead
  of clamping it to -128 or 127 if original value can't fit in a byte.
  Same problem was with words and longs. (Aske Christensen)
- uaeserial.device compatibility fixes
- A500 D80000-DDFFFF area is unmapped (except possible RTC at DC0000)
  higher end models can have other MB devices here
- A1000 is most likely the only Amiga model that has custom chips
  mapped at D80000-DDFFFF
- RTC access is now exactly same as in real A500 (if more compatible
  setting enabled)
- AGA end of fast (or chip if no fast) to BBFFFF is not mapped, same
  with C00000 to D7FFFF. (Need more testing)
  Mapping changes may help with some buggy programs that poke illegal
  addresses.
- My A1200 seems to have KS ROM mapped at 0xA80000-B7FFFF. But with
  Blizzard 1260 installed it is replaced with 64kb "bank" of RAM from
  card's expansion RAM.. It seems all "unmapped" areas map to
  Blizzard's expansion RAM. Quite interesting effect.. (not emulated)
- serial port detection update. For some reason not all serial ports
  (at least some USB types) can't be detected by enumerating
  GUID_CLASS_COMPORT class. (and this was supposed to be the proper
  way to do it..)
- do not log KS motherboard RAM probe (less useless spam when booting)
- Picasso96 graphics corruption introduced in previous betas should
  be fixed (also other changes, can be faster or slower in some cases,
  also there is possibility something else broke..)

Beta 5:

- CD32/CDTV emulation now autodetects all CD (all drives) changes on
  the fly. Previously drive was only autodetected once when emulation
  started.
- blitter linedraw update, PD game Tanx (not same game as Tanx in HOL,
  ID=5409) uses really "interesting" way for drawing vertical lines,
  it sets ADAT=FFFF and BLTAFWM=8000.
- remove agnus/denise revision settings. Will be replaced with more
  flexible configuration later (perhaps select box with real chip
  identification strings, current system couldn't support for example
  oldest Denise without EHB and Agnus with buggy blitter wait bit)
- another possible bsdsocket thread timing bug fix
- running p96refresh automatically forces power supply cia-a tod to
  prevent clock running faster
- mapping of RTG RAM adjusted (locate immediately after end of Z3 RAM
  and align to 16M border), fix board size (previously <16M was
  reported incorrectly in Scout)
- Arcadia added to ROM scan message (but only if Arcadia bios rom(s)
  detected, Arcadia: unavailable would only confuse users..)

Beta 4:

- separate Arcadia bios and game rom selection
  (rom rescan required) Idea and original patch by Karsten Bock
- "Add PC drives at startup"/"Include network drives" fixed
- cd32/cdtv/arcadia flashfile set to <datapath>\<mode>.nvr
  in quickstart modes
- CDTV 64kb sram card quickstart mode added, saved to flashfile with
  CDTV internal sram (tested with Sim City CDTV)
- harddisk panel fixes and updates. Non-existing hardfiles and
  directories are marked with "X".

Beta 3:

- remove harddrives loaded from default.uae in quickstart-mode
- wrong device/volumename in harddisk panel (visual error only)
- S<something> in command line parameters set illegal stereo
  separation value in some cases
- hardfile configuration handling bugs fixed
- disk history list wrong item selection fixed (really old bug,
  select second entry from disk history then select first entry
  from other drive's disk history)
- sinc interpolator update from uaede 2.04
- CDTV CD audio play end position status change detection improved
- application icon updated (also includes 256x256 Vista-style icon)
- CD access freeze when CD was already open in another program, also
  tries shared access mode first before falling back to exclusive
  mode
- emulation paused mode sound start/stop issues fixed


Beta 2:

- filter zoom and position is not restricted to coordinates divisible
  by 4 pixels anymore
- datapath command line parameter fixed (broke in 1.3.4b9)
- enumerate only known DirectInput devices types (keyboards, pointers
  and game controllers), apparently there are some broken DI compatible
  "unknown" devices that crash DirectInput's internal enumeration code..
- "magic mouse" related freezes fixed
- dragndrop disk insert fixed (again..)
- added more Picasso96 modes to "unique" mode list
- possible fix for some missing Picasso96 display modes
- added Amiga-side pointer validation to bsdsocket (smaller chance for
  crashing if Amiga-side program passes garbage to bsdsocket)
- added safe host<>Amiga memcpy/strcpy helper functions to memory.c
- Aminetradio bsdsocket freeze fix (broke in 1340b6)
- do not "fix" configuration when advanced chipset compatible checkbox
  is not checked and using A4000 rom.
- Windows driver Catweasel-mode works again
- only access CW registers if CW mouse/joystick is selected, read
  keyboard port only if CW checkbox is enabled

Beta 1: Lots of scary options. Do not touch!

- added new misc configuration options "(handled in previous versions)"
  - RTC type (none, MSM6242B or RF5C01A) + adjustment in seconds
    (always enabled, MSM6242B but no 26x4bit memory implemented
    and was initialized as RF5C01A... Looks like previous developer(s)
    didn't know there was two different clock chips, neither did I
    until few days ago.. Basically 68020+ Amigas have RF5C01A)
  - CIA-A TOD clock source, vblank/50hz/60hz (always vblank except
    50Hz/60Hz in programmed modes, another hack was here)
  - built-in IDE A600+A1200 or A4000. Not really doing much yet.
    (something that prevented IDE detection delay)
  - A1000 Boot "ROM" on/off (enabled when 8k/64k ROM was used)
  - DF0: ID hardware on/off (no ID if DF0: was 35DD)
  - A3000/A4000 "motherboard resources", RAMSEY and/or Fat GARY
    (0xDE000x, 0 = TOENB, 1 = TIMEOUT and 2 = COLDREBOOT registers)
  - KS ROM mirror at 0xe00000-0xe7ffff (Cloanto ROM selected)
  - CD32 CDROM on/off (when 512k extended ROM was selected)
  - CD32 C2P on/off (when 512k extended ROM was selected)
  - CD32 NVRAM on/off (when 512k extended ROM was selected)
  - CDTV CDROM on/off (did not exist)
  - CDTV NVRAM on/off (when 256k extended ROM was selected)
  - CDTV SRAM (64k only, not saved) Card on/off (not implemented)

  Why? Because there are small differences between different Amiga
  models and even revisions and every possible model must be
  configurable for emulation.. (like more real A4000 configuration)
  Also can remove some ugly hacks (like the IDE hack) with proper
  emulation.
  
  I REPEAT: Do not touch Adv.Chipset panel if you aren't sure about
  what you are doing! :)

  NOTE: A4000 KS ROMs (Cloanto 3.x ROMs = A4000 ROM) _REQUIRE_ RAMSEY
  or they will freeze at boot. WinUAE will automatically enable RAMSEY
  and GARY if recognised A4000 ROM is selected, also default "Generic"
  Amiga setting is most compatible with old configurations.

  NOTE2: CD32 and CDTV configurations require now CD32 or CDTV setting
  in chipset-panel (Quickstart mode does this automatically). Previously
  CD32/CDTV mode was enabled depending on size of extended ROM but that
  is not a good idea anymore.

- Amiga model specific chipset extra settings added, available only if
  "compatible settings" is enabled in "Adv. Chipset" panel
- Akiko moved to separate memory bank (was in CIA bank previously, no
  functional changes)
- Configurable motherboard resources memory bank added (includes Fat
  Gary DE0000, DE0001, DE0002 and RAMSEY DE0003 and DE0043)
- RAMSEY revision configurable
- Fat Gary revision configurable (AFAIK this does not exist in existing
  chips but was planned in future. But Scout detects this so...)
- 2 x RAMSEY (A3000/A4000 memory controller chip) controlled 32-bit MB
  Fast RAM configuration added. ROM support for detection needed.
  - First max 64MB "bank" ends at 0x08000000 (A3000/A4000 ROM needed)
  - Second max 64MB "bank" from 0x08000000 (as above plus any 3.1+ ROM)
  In theory there is space for max 96MB but UAE memory system does not
  like non-power of 2 memory areas. Can be used with RTG and Z3 RAM.
- Configurable DDxxxx (A3000/A4000 SCSI) DMAC memory bank added (not
  yet doing anything)
- CDTV emulation support! (thanks to Mark Knibbs for debugging CDTV
  ROMs two years ago)
  - data and audio tracks supported
  - CDXL animations work better than in CD32 emulation
  - CD audio volume control not supported
  - multithreaded, no emulation pauses because of possible slow CD
    access or CD spin up/down. May not be fully stable yet.
  - 1x drive speed emulation
  - 2MB chip enabled in CDTV Quickstart because DF0: is always
    detected (even without drive) and apparently some games need all
    available memory. KS 1.x always uses DF0: and I am not sure how
    CDTV ROM should disable it (or does it do it? CDTV don't have
    built-in floppy drive)
  - starting data CD read without aborting previous CD audio
    freezes (for example DOTC), cdtv device driver keeps waiting
    for some signal that does not appear. (returning error status
    will fix this but it also breaks Xenon II, hopefully proper
    fix is found soon..)
- do not draw onscreen leds ofscreen (left border in narrow modes)
- "Magic" mouse option added (wip) System friendly screens + windowed
  mode only. There is still offset in position when using native
  screen.
- disk read DMA without any selected drives will finish normally
  (would have frozen emulated program in previous versions)
- "Faster RTG" "instant copper" does not freeze even if copper list
  has infinite loop.
- removed A2000 from A500/A2000 quickstart setting, they aren't
  100% same hardware (A2000 has DF0: ID hardware and CIA-A TOD clock
  is powersupply tick by default)
- IOCTL (used by CD32/CDTV emulation) CD access digital CD audio
  work in Vista (previously total silence when using Daemon Tools
  or no sound cable between CD drive and sound card)
  Ugly detail: it closes CreateFile() handle and opens MCI handle
  when CD audio calls are needed (and back to CreateFile() when
  accessing data)
- Current open GUI config panel was initialized, destroyed and
  initialized again when entering GUI and emulation was running.
- selecing keyboard layout C and then selecting any other keyboard
  layout didn't disable layout C.
- Quickstart disk swap delayed insert fixed again
- D3D does not depend on D3DX library anymore (no more need for
  dec 2004 DX SDK to prevent d3dx9_xx.dll dependancy)
- harddisk configuration handling completely rewritten. Configuration
  data and mount data are now separate, configuration data is copied
  to mount data only when starting or reseting the emulation.
  Also failed mounting won't delete the configuration data.
  No more disappearing configuration entries if paths have changed
  or USB device is not inserted or error messages when adjusting
  configuration settings when emulation is already running.
  First column shows if the device is currently mounted
- sound filter/interpolation etc was not initialized until GUI panel
  was visited

1.3.4 (30.12.2006)

Beta 9:

- interrupt timing tweak (Gravity Force in ce-mode)
- CPU Idle tweak (slightly less aggressive)
- file dialogs work again in Windows9X/ME..
- sound problems really fixed now

Beta 8: (RC3, really final?)

- random sound automatic restart delay fixed
- sound underflow handling improved
- JIT NATMEM VirtalFree() incorrect parameters fixed (MS Application
  Verifier report)

Beta 7: (RC2)

- AGA sprites outside display window emulated when sprite is above or
  below the display window. Previously they were only visible when
  it was on left or right side of display window.
  (fixes Spheris Legacy missing status graphics)
- clear garbage at the bottom of screen for example when switching from
  doubled to non-doubled 
- serial port set to none in config file didn't work properly
- cloned stereo and 4 channel sound mode uses proper initialization
  (according to MSDN WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE is required if >2 channels but
  for some reason "incorrect" way also worked previously..)
- mask unused DIWHIGH bits, could have caused narrow image appearing on
  screen when loading statefile with DIWHIGH having highest bit set and
  ECS Agnus or AGA enabled.
- border blanking feature (ECS/AGA BPLCON3 BRDRBLNK-bit) now also
  updates top and bottom borders

Beta 6: (RC)

- serial port "friendly" names listed in serial port selection,
  also detects virtual (for example bluetooth) serial ports.
  Windows 2000+ only. W9X/ME shows normal "legacy" names.
- more bsdsocket stability fixes
- 1M ROM image support (upper half maps to regular KS space,
  lower half to 0xe00000) Apparently A600/A1200/A4000 does the
  same with 2x512K EPROMs
- compiler optimization settings changed for release build

Beta 5:

- remove winuae-specific command line parameters before passing
  them to configuration parser.
- internal serial and parallel port selection updates
  (partially in b4 + fixes in b5)
- Paula serial port emulation fixed (broke in b4)
- more uaeserial.device tweaks
- defined more Picasso96 modeIDs, now most PC display modes have
  unique ID (updating display card/drivers, moving between PCs
  does not anymore cause mysterious mode changes)
  NOTE: you may need to reset your Picasso96 display mode if you
  used mode other than 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024 or
  1600x1200.
- fixed another random Picasso96<>native switching crash
- added -maxmem command line parameter, "-maxmem 1024" enables 1G
  Z3Fast support. (32-bit max) Note: can cause random side-effects
  depending on total memory and/or Windows version.. Large RTG RAM
  sizes require larger maxmem parameter (but values over ~1060 may
  not work, check winuaebootlog.txt). Pointless but fun option :)
- vsync mode sound pitch shifting fixed. Pitch can still shift
  slightly in some cases.
- bsdsocket stability fix

Beta 4:

- uaeserial.device tweaks
- added more logging to RDB parser
- do not reopen DirectSound when losing/gaining focus
- DirectSound initialization changes
- drivesound disk selection menu selected wrong entry in some cases
- rare divide by zero error when running Amiga program tries to
  program 1 line tall display mode
- final MSVC 2005 SP1 installed
- dual core/SMP hardfile freeze fix (RD)
- bsdsocket bug fix that could have caused buffer overflows

Beta 3:

- uaeserial.device implemented, serial.device-like device that maps
  unit numbers directly to host's COMx-ports (unit 1 = COM1, 2 = COM2
  etc..) Supports most serial.device features (No xOn/xOff support)
  Bugs possible. Tested using Term and Nokia E70 via bluetooth serial
  connection :)
- page down is now properly configurable in input-panel (previously
  was internally always mapped to freeze button)
- GUI AHI sound volume adjustment support (previously was Paula only)
- disk emulation event handler error fixed, broke most custom loaders
  (bug introduced in b1)
- X-Arcade GUI tooltip compatibility update, in some cases only tiny
  piece of upper left corner was visible. (Vista only?)
- more blitter tweaks, try to be compatible with broken programs that
  write to blitter registers while previous blit has not yet finished.
- some DirectSound tweaks

Beta 2:

- fixed possible crash when input recording stops (introduced in b1)
- log memory map after reset and also after autoconfig
- log loaded KS ROM information in memory map dump
- fixed boot crash (some CPU/KS combinations only)
- bug in new event handler fixed (symptom was random really slow
  non-ce/non-immediate blitter)
- interrupt priorities are correct again (broke in b1) Some tweaks.
- filesystem flag emulation updates (again) Protection flags on FAT
  volumes should now work properly in non-UAEFSDB mode.
- filesystem directory protection flags supported (on FAT volumes)
  Very old comment says: "Unix dirs behave differently than AmigaOS
  ones. windows dirs go where no dir has gone before..." Perhaps
  Windows 95 had some issues? Hope I didn't miss something..

Beta 1:

- dms files inside archives automatically added to disk history
- Windows98/ME direct MK4 catweasel support. Need command line
  parameter "-directcatweasel 0xyzzzz". y = CW model (3 or 4,
  3 is default), zzzz is io address in hexadecimal. (simple, quick
  workaround if someone really wants to use MK3/4 under 98/ME for
  some unknown reason) IO address in configuration file is obsoleted
  (was never compatible with CW joystick or mouse port detection)
- Catweasel MK4 mouse support fixed (broke in 1.3.3)
- Catweasel direct mode automatically enabled if Windows is 2000
  or newer, IO library is installed and CW driver is not installed
  (previously was automatically enabled only if OS was 64-bit)
- compiler updated to beta SP1. I am very anti-"don't fix it if it
  is not broken" person but I think you must already know it :)
- updated to latest Windows SDK
- winuaeclipboard crash fix (BR)
- finally replaced really ugly interrupt delay hack with more
  cleaner and accurate method (fixes Fun School 4)
- made non-ce "more compatible" CPU emulators' main loop more
  compatible with programs requiring delayed interrups
- windowed mode "leds" had incorrect mouse click positions
- debugger memwatch "freeze" option now also accepts memory values
- added separate memory bank function for 680x0 opcode fetches
- debugger memwatch points can now detect between opcode fetch
  and data fetch, 68000-only currently.
- basic self modifying code (SMC) detection implemented in
  debugger (smc-command) Works in 68000-mode only.
- Windows Vista rawinput crash fix (weird change in vista..)
- avioutput sound sync errors fixed (broke in 1.3.3)
- avioutput video codec type registry saving improved
- fixed CPU emulation condition code bug caused by compiler bug or
  undefined C behaviour (not sure yet..) Affected some copy
  protections. Introduced in E-UAE merge.
- added horizontal mouse wheel input-panel support (hwheel support
  added in Windows Vista, not tested)
- add single "fake" button entry if joystick driver reports zero
  buttons (PPJoy in two-player mode, no idea if this helps)
- cleaned up AHI emulation, initialize and start recording only
  when requested for the first time
- disk image dragndrop caused instant disk swap instead of delayed
  swap (eject, wait 1.5s, insert new disk)
- fixed Windows only bug in new stack magic replacement code, both
  bsdsocket and AHI leaked Windows handles (SR)
- less aggressive sound adjustment
- horizontally scrolling list view selection fix (for example input
  panel with wide enough key name could have made autofire selection
  impossible)
- inputrecording reliability increased (but it still loses sync)

Final 1.3.3

- sound stereo channel swap setting was not saved to config..
- added "affinity <value>" -command line parameter, sets CPU affinity
  bit mask (1=first CPU only, default. 2 = second CPU only, 4 = third,
  3 = CPU 1 + 2 etc.. 0 = original startup affinity value)

Beta 8: (RC1, GUI DLL included)

- unrar.dll supported, rar-archives do not need archiveaccess.dll
  + rar support files anymore (archiveaccess support not removed)
  Note that unrar.dll is stupid, it only allows filename as an
  input archive (instead of memory pointer) which means rar archives
  inside archives can't be unpacked without archiveaccess.
- clear only first 8MB of Z3 RAM during hard reset (full clear of
  Z3 RAM can cause swapping if low on physical RAM)
- remove possible orphaned files (files that have been deleted from
  Windows side) from directory filesystem's cache (BR)
- disk eject and reset from GUI ignored the eject (broke in b4)
- floppy leds write status color works properly
- GUI in 640x480 fullscreen was incorrectly centered in some cases
- removed timestamps from winuaebootlog.txt

Beta 7:

- CIA TOD does not "re-latch" if it has already been latched
  (A1200 confirmed)
- CIA TOD hardware bug emulated, TODMED counts .. 1D 1E 1F
  10 20 21 22.. (1F->10->20 is only couple of cycles but it
  will trigger alarm comparison, not visible to normal programs
  that read TODHI first and TODLOW last)
  (A500, A1200, CD32 confirmed)
- hard reset zeroes all memory types (previously cleared only
  chip memory)
- time base calculation does not overflow even if future PCs
  have 10GHz+ timer resolution :)
- bsdsocket waitselect fix, fixes Remote Desktop (SR)
- filesystem Windows file flag handling fixes (detection if Windows
  flags support current Amiga-side flag combination or if uaefsdb
  is needed has been broken for a long time..)
  List of supported flags/flag combinations: (x = no care)
  H = Windows Hidden flag
  P = Windows System flag
  A = Windows Archive flag
  S set = not supported, FSDB required
  E or R not set = FSDB required
  xxxxR-E- = Windows Read Only flag
  ----RWED = default, no Windows flags set
  other combinations = FSDB required  
- some incorrect blitter cycle sequences corrected,
  fixes Twintris in non-immediate blitter modes.

Beta 6:

- ProWizard updated to 1.61
- added logging if required filesystem is missing (not in RDB and in
  FileSystem.resource)
- RTG RAM max size increased to 64MB (64 and 128 have always been
  possible via manual configuration file editing, 128 not in GUI
  because it may cause problems if combined with 512MB Z3)
- "mousehack mouse" crashed without HD emulation (=no UAE "boot rom")
- increased sound "resync" range again
- "100% accurate"-sound mode tweak, no more huge cpu usage in some
  games that "misuse" AUDxPER-register.
  (for example Paradroid 90, Rambo III..)
- TVicPort direct io support added (includes also 64-bit Windows
  support which is missing from winio, winio support not removed)
  http://www.entechtaiwan.com/dev/port/index.shtm
- CWMK4 direct io support + latest FPGA core built-in. CWMK4 now
  works under 64-bit Windows (yeah, very hackish way but it really
  does work..)
  PCI IO address is automatically detected (also supports MK3),
  Windows 2000 or newer only. Direct IO & PCI scan is only used if
  Windows driver is not installed and running under 64-bit Windows
  (no CW drivers) or -directcatweasel command line parameter is used.
  Direct IO is never used if Windows driver is present.
- Zoom! (SPS version) exception 3 hack (exception3 return address
  is not defined by Motorola, another "problem" when emulating
  microcoded CPU..)

Beta 5:

- built-in 7zip decompression (there is now official, easy to use
  license compatible C-only support library. Old C++/COM library
  was completely unusable.. built-in rar still missing due to
  license incompatibility)
- rom.key system rewrite, old and new (AF2006) rom keys supported
  simultaneously
- RDB HDF partition mount failed if correct filesystem was in ROM
  but RDB contains one or more not needed filesystems  
- Lightpen/gun emulation (available in input-panel, mouse-only)
  Enforcer and Orbital Destroyer confirmed working
  NOTE: random cursor trails possible. not tested in hires or
  laced modes.
  NOTE2: Trojan phazer fire button is joystick 2 left!
  (and Orbital Destroyer crashes if normal fire is pressed..)
- Faster RTG (picasso96_nocustom) added to GUI
- Faster RTG does not disable audio anymore (use automatic
  sound stop/start system instead). Also copper moves are now
  emulated instantly (all waits are simply ignored, shouldn't matter
  in RTG modes, copper is used basically only for setting hidden
  refresh rates for Paula audio frequency hacks etc..)
  Enabled by default now, should not cause any issues anymore.
- added misc-panel checkbox for allowing Windows screen/powersavers
  while WinUAE is active (previously powersaving features were
  always disabled)

Beta 4:

- rom scanner lists nondetected roms (with CRC32) in log
- improved sound underflow detection
- better approximation of sound delay values in GUI
  (includes hidden delay caused by DirectSound)
- sound led didn't always light when sound emulation was
  re-enabled
- sound autostart/stop config option (enabled by default)
- removed latency slider, new sound system should adjust
  automatically
- disable sound autostop if recording is enabled
- only use recording-mode sound auto-adjust while recording
  previously used both..
- RTG RAM enabled without Z3 RAM crash fix (broke in 1.3.2)
- debugger ea lists real AGA color registers instead of
  host RGB values..
- fixed debugger e-command random crashing
- remove some obsolete MSVC 2002 and older project files
- floppy sound didn't restart autostopped audio
- GUI disk eject-button is delayed until exiting emulation
  (fixes "instant disk swap" bug if clicking eject and then
  immediately selecting new image)

Beta 3:

- more sound tweaks, added warning "led" colors to sound buffer
  status. red = underflow (very bad), blue = nearing overflow
  situation (sound lag will get larger but no sound quality
  problems), yellow = overflow prevention triggered (still no
  sound problems but emulation will lose CPU power)
- buffer is filled with empty sample data if underflow happens,
  prevents buffer wraparound and few seconds of totally out of
  sync sound
- new feature: (could be broken feature..) stop audio emulation
  if sound hardware has been idle for 2 seconds. emulation restarts
  immediately when any audio related register is accessed (even
  if it causes no sound like setting volume to zero during boot
  process by Kickstart ROM)
  Stopped = no paula audio or resampling and mixing, host sound
  hardware is still playing empty buffer to prevent any possible
  sound glitches during starting/stopping
- point of sound buffer led is to make sound problem debugging
  easier

Beta 2:

- ReleaseCopyOfSocket() bsdsocket.library implemented,
  fixes AmiVNC (SR)
- input-panel: key mapped to <none> reverted back to its default
  mapping after saving and loading the configuration
- hardfile TD_GETGEOMETRY caused one byte memory overflow
  (long write to DriveGeometry.flags instead of byte..)
- uaescsi.device cleanup breakage fix (direct scsi didn't work etc..)
- HD_SCSICMD now returns error (unimplemented command) instead of
  not doing anything and returning success if SCSI-support is not
  available
- ROM scanner can now detect AF2006 rom.key even if it has been
  renamed, also some other ROM scanner tweaks
- partial sound handling rewrite, some tweaking still needed
  make sure lag adjustment is zeroed before testing!
- added sound buffer status "led", -30 to 30 is ok (the closer to
  zero the better) bigger values most likely cause sound issues.
  value jumping to very high or small value for few seconds after
  reset/resolution change/state file load/etc is normal
- increased "led" update rate
- "vertical scanline"-effect in 16-bit AGA modes fixed
- version changed to 1.3.3, no 1.4 until E-UAE merges and
  sound system updates are tested in public

Beta 1:

- merged portable stack magic replacement from E-UAE
- merged 68k regs-struct optimizations from E-UAE
- merged genlinetoscr from E-UAE + implemented filtered lores support
  (filtered lores now also includes "special" modes like HAM, EHB etc)
- other random E-UAE source cleanups ect merging (part 1/x)
- MSVC version of REGPARAM (__fastcall) enabled and
  USE_NORMAL_CALLING_CONVENTION disabled.
- breakage and performance increase possible, see above :)
- HDF/real HD access optimizations, removed one unneeded temporary
  buffering layer.
- replaced mostly unusable TFHB keyboard layout with "standard" WASD.
- Reset-button in GUI forces hard-reset now
- ignore DMS CRC errors while unpacking instead of aborting the
  process, for example previously harmless error in track 1 created
  completely unusable image even if all other tracks were 100% ok
- encrypted DMS files are transparently decrypted (16-bit
  "encryption key" can be brute-forced quickly..)
- GUI genlock connected-checkbox was broken
- audio emulation tweak, previously audio.device AbortIO() and then
  CMD_WRITE could have caused lost audio interrupt
- memory watchpoint F option added, "freezes" (ignores writes)
  selected address range

1.3.2

Beta 2:

- Mouse Up/Down and Left/Right input destinations can now work
  simultaneously (diagonal movement) Really works now.
- Amithlon partition detection should now work without need to
  disable safety checks
- avioutput audio recording in cloned stereo mode created incorrect
  audio (2 channel instead of 4 and 1/2 the pitch, proper way
  would be to change 4 channels back to 2, maybe later..)
- dskrdy-delay added, apparently there is very small delay before
  dskrdy changes state after switching motor off.
  (fixes Pro Tennis Tour's stupid loader)

Beta 1:

- don't open debug console when restoring state or when quitting..
- ignore printer autoflush timeout if Postscript detection is enabled
  (autoflush during Postscript parsing will quietly abort the print
  process..)
- Mouse Up/Down and Left/Right input destinations can now work
  simultaneously (diagonal movement)
- extended ROM statefile support
- CD32 statefiles supported. CD32 configuration must be set
  before loading the statefile. (will be fixed in future)
- don't save hrtmon to statefile if it has not been activated at
  least once (=hrtmon data has been modified and needs to be saved)
- FDI 2.1 format support, header checksum supported
- HRTMon DE/F keyboard layout autodetection really works now
- HRTMon WHDLoad commands don't cause WHDLoad stack error message
  anymore (for example wq)
- A1000 Kickstart disk image can be used as a ROM image file, also
  supported by ROM scanner
- Z3Fast start address can be set in configuration file. Don't touch
  it if you don't know what you are doing!


1.3.1

Beta 3:

- blitter timing updates. Maybe I am becoming crazy or something
  but I did another test and enabling A-channel does not "anymore"
  steal all bus cycles like I thought it did previously.. Or maybe
  it does in specific situations only. Anyway, Hostages insta-kill
  fixed again. broken since 1.1b4..
- more SPTI and ASPI tweaks
- bad access fault fixed in mousehack replacement code (could cause
  random crashes etc..)
  
Beta 2:

- drag'n'dropping disk images now adds them to disk history list
- drag'n'dropped floppy panel disk image file names were truncated
  if name included "]["-string
- removed "force ECS Agnus if chip ram > 512k"-fix. It is too
  restricting when trying fun configurations, should not be needed
  because of quickstart configuration. At least I hope so..
- avioutput framerate limit and fps stored in registry
- HRTMon colors replaced with "Action Replay colors". (B&W looked too
  boring... configurable in future)
- debugger "unstopped" the CPU if CPU was in stopped state when
  activating the debugger.
- debugger trainer code cleanups, z3fast added to trainers and
  prowizard
- "deep trainer" (idea stolen from Action Replay III) added to
  debugger. GUI for trainers will be added in future, with memory
  location "freeze"-option. Cl = list found trainer addresses

  Ds = start deep trainer (or plain D if this is the first time),
  continue game and lose live (or time or whatever), D = rescans
  memory and removes all addresses that have not changed since last
  scan. Repeat until correct location is found. (may take many many
  times..) Dx = rescans memory and removes all addresses that HAVE
  CHANGED since last scan.

Beta 1:

- uaescsi.device CMD_WRITE/CMD_FORMAT commands implemented (not just
  returning write protected anymore), CMD_READ also works with non-CD
  devices. Testing needed, I don't have any zip drives or similar..
- force bogoram size to 1MB if >1MB bogoram and AGA enabled
  configuration is loaded. (fixes crash if JIT is enabled)
  Gayle IO space conflicts with >1MB bogo. In reality this is totally
  bogus configuration because there are no real AGA machines with
  bogo (slow) ram...
- fixed original extended adf (Factor 5 disk images) decoding error,
  broke somewhere during 1.3 betas..
- ASPI tweaks (may or may not help with some random issues)
- disable cycle-exact if 68020/68040+JIT configuration is loaded
  (not supported configuration and has already caused too many
  useless bug reports because it can cause weird problems..)
- map Gayle memory bank if 68020+ (A4000 KS will freeze without
  something in Gayle space)
- 1280 display width limitation changed to 2048 (real current
  maximum) Previously selecting >1280xYYYY resolution would change
  to 1280xYYYY and cause weird errors.. Also unsupported >2048
  resolutions are not listed in resolution list anymore.
- HRTMon updated to 2.30
- "blitter unstuck" hack (if blitter is stuck for more than 3 frames
  due to blitter DMA being disabled, it will be forced to finish.
  Only enabled in immediate blitter-mode. Compatibility hack for
  some JIT game problems, for example SlamTilt Pinball)
- sound filter configuration load bug
- mostly harmless access fault fixed in "boot rom"
  FileSystem.resource list scanner
- "log illegal memory access"-option does not anymore log Z3
  expansion area (0xff0000xx) and extended rom area (0x00f00000)
- WHDLoad HRTMon detection works now (NOTE: hrtmon must be activated
  manually at least once before it works. WIP)
- avioutput recording incorrectly split the avi when focus was lost
- avioutput codec configuration stored in registry
- first avioutput recorded frame is not blank anymore
- window close button and GUI quit-button didn't work if emulation
  was paused
- changing filters didn't reset graphics subsystem properly
- D3D filter problems fixed, again and again.. (I hope..)

1.3

Beta 8: (second RC)

- ASPI crash fixed
- W9x/ME language dll error log spam really fixed
- hrtmon moved to 0x00a10000 (w9x/me conflict really fixed)
- uade "Sinc" interpolator fixed 

Beta 7: (RC, beta removed from about-panel)

- Action Replay state save/restore should finally work, HRTMon state
  file support added. Old AR state files are not compatible anymore!
- A1200 Action Replay CIA snooping added, previously exiting AR
  caused totally corrupt data written back to CIA registers
- don't map "filesystem boot rom" if no hard drives are enabled
  ("ROM" was visible even in basic A500-mode at 0xf00000) (b6 update)
- Quickstart CDTV description bug fixed
- preparing for uaescsi.device non-CD trackdisk support
  (will be fully implemented after 1.3 is out)
- drivesound (non PC-drive) crash fixed
- Picasso96 graphics crap fixed if P96 window was smaller than full
  P96 display window (BR)
- ROM names changed to "KS ROM xxx" (less confusing, I hope..)
- some key events were passed to emulation while END-key was kept
  pressed
- don't fill log with language DLL load errors if running W9x/ME
  (for some reason W9X/ME returns ERROR_DLL_NOT_FOUND but 2000/XP
  returns ERROR_MOD_NOT_FOUND)
- don't try to create crash dump under W9X/ME, it won't work.
- dm-debugger command fix (last bank was missed)
- hrtmon moved to 0x00a00000 (no more conflicts with 8MB fast RAM)

Beta 6:

- HRTMon 68000 bug fixed (tried to read non-existing stack frame type
  when CPU was 68000 causing crash while freezing if freezed program
  was running in supervisor mode)
- Set German/French HRTMon keyboard layout automatically
- dm debugger memory space dump command added
- AHI updates (BR)
- updated to latest uaede filters ('sinc' is currently broken)
- changing interpolation setting on the fly sometimes didn't work
  correctly
- updated uae home page url in about-panel (when did it change?)
- shutting down WinUAE caused infinite recursion and stack overflow
  when there was already another WinUAE's named pipe open
- Paths-panel info changes: "Amiga Forever 2005" -> "Amiga Forever"
  (2005, 2006 and future releases should use same directory format)
- GUI: removed all (?) visible Commodore trademarks (if they even
  exists today) like "Kickstart". Stupid yeah but you never know..
- some directory filesystem disk full errors were not converted to
  proper AmigaOS error code

Beta 5:

- "cloned stereo" mode added to sound panel (4 channel mode that
  mirrors front channels to rear channels)
- Action Replay A1200 cartridge support
- HRTMon 2.29 "cartridgefied" and is now WinUAE build-in
  (should even work in JIT and Picasso96 modes)
- fixed incorrect numpad key shortcut statefile default path
- added separate Gayle address bank, needed for future IDE controller
  hardfile emulation (A600/A1200/A4000 compatible) Will be implemented
  after 1.3 is out (I read ATA-1 spec yesterday and it was surprisingly
  simple. All "intelligence" is inside the drive, Gayle basically only
  works as an address decoder)

Beta 4:

- replaced directory harddrive size check code with >2G compatible
  code (but it may not help much because of Amiga-side software
  size calculation overflow bugs)
- UNC directory harddrives (\\server\share) work now properly
  (previously ACTION_INFO returned error, for example Shell command
  "info" ignored the drive)
- harddrive hdf creator compatibility updates
- wider harddrive selector window, swapped name and size
- directory harddrive protection flag bug (beta 2)
- overlay workaround for broken ATI X1x00-series card drivers
  (blank RGB overlay since Catalyst 6.1) -enableowr force-enables,
  -disableowr force-disables.
- 3.5" "ESCOM" floppy drive type added (Some newer A1200s came with
  modified PC drives that don't support DSKRDY-signal) Useless?!
- RTE stack frame 7 added (needed when/if MMU emulation happens..)
 
Beta 3:

- Check ROM checksum only if ROM looks like a regular Kickstart ROM
  Currently searches for "exec.library" in the first 256 bytes of ROM.
- interlace-bug fix tweaking (and i am still not happy with the fix)
- uade filter update, 44100Hz-only restriction is gone. Removed old
  filter emulation code. UADE filter/interpolation improvements by
  Antti S. Lankila
- state restore fix, some 68010+ CPU state files required loading of
  statefile twice (first load would cause Amiga-side crash because
  of trying to access not yet mapped memory)
- extended debugger e-command, ea = list AGA color registers
- added timestamps to log files (both real world and frames+vhpos)
- changing fpu_strict on the fly works
- D3D fullscreen freeze fixed (btw, December 2004 DXSDK is the last
  SDK with statically linked d9dx library)
- priority-panel pause emulation/disable sound output checkboxes
  were always shown as unticked
- directories with "illegal" characters work now in NTFS stream
  -style directory filesystems (previously for example directory
  named "blah>" would have changed back to real Windows-side
  directory named "__uae___blah" after reboot)
- only create stream fsdb -file if file/directory has illegal
  name, unsupported protection flags or comment set, also delete
  the stream-file if file does not have illegal attributes anymore
- clear disk history -button added to paths-panel
- CPU% >99% is shown without %-sign in onscreen leds because of
  not enough space

Beta 2:

- motor on/off state added to PC floppy drive sound emulation
  (fdrawcmd.sys >= 1.0.1.9, not yet released)
  NOTE: due to another stupid PC hardware limitation, motor must
  always be switched on while seeking (even if emulated motor
  is not switched on)
- MSDOS DD (720k) and HD (1440k) disk images supported
  (PC0: works fine but PCTask or Transformer won't accept DOS
  images for some unknown reason)
- possible Picasso96 screen switch crash workaround
- disk image drag'n'drop to main window fixed
- disk image drag'n'drop to status bar df0-df3 "leds" added
- input recording disk image change support added
- Both "exe" and "data" path will be used when looking for Help
  file (WinUAE.chm). Previously only "data" path was used.
- selecting from disk history (rarely) selected wrong entry
- "simple" gfx option changes on the fly don't force whole gfx
  system reset anymore (close & open screen)
- No more "No disk in drive x"-dialogs if disk history had paths
  pointing to removed removable drives (for example USB sticks)
- NeroASPI-path had extra \-character (Maybe only if Nero 7 is
  installed?)
- don't cache comment or unsupported protection flags internally if
  drive does not support UAEFSDB or NTFS streams (setting comment and
  immediately using Examine() returned saved comment even if it was
  not possible to store comments or flags to disk)
- paths-panel "WinUAE default"-setting uses relative paths. Only
  if "data" and "exe" paths are identical
- fixed AVIOutput crashes and incorrect display positioning in some
  situations
- 68000 RESET-instruction prefetch update (needed by proper Arcadia
  boot sequence, fixes ancient PC emulator Transformer)
- Arcadia emulation update from MAME 0.105u3. Uses now correct
  boot method which works with Kickstart 1.2 (old one needed KS 1.3)
  Fixes Sidewinder graphics errors (game requires KS 1.2)
- sound filter adjustments, separated filter on/emulated/off state
  from filter type. now uses uade filters by default (only if
  44100Hz frequency is selected, this limitation will be fixed
  in future by uade filter author)
- added "anti" and "sinc" interpolators from uade and set "anti"
  as a default. (note: "sinc" needs much more CPU time than other
  interpolators)
- strip ending :'s from device and volume names (seen some bug
  reports about missing harddrives because of illegal names)
- frogaspi.dll support added (http://www.frogaspi.org/)
  FrogASPI is free ASPI library (frogaspi.dll worked with older
  WinUAE versions but only if it was renamed to wnaspi32.dll)
- blitter state save fix. should fix random frozen emulation after
  restoring. (note: error happens while saving, old damaged statefiles
  won't be automatically fixed)
- "scanline"-effect in changed parts of display while in interlace
  mode bug finally fixed! (for example Pinball Illusions' score panel
  in hires mode)
- very experimental automatic lores/doubling switching added.
  Enable any filter that allows 1x/2x-checkboxes and tick "autoscale"
  at the bottom of filter panel.
  
  Now lores and doubling is automatically changed on the fly.
  - lores/nonlace: lores enabled, doubling disabled, horizontal
    and vertical filter multiplier set to 2x
  - hires/nonlace: lores disabled, doubling disabled, horizontal
    filter multipler 1x, vertical 2x
  - etc..
  - mixed hires and lores forces hires-mode (lores disabled)
  
  So whats the point? Filter 1x/2x scaling is free (display card's
  blitter does it). lores/doubling scaling uses CPU. Most games and
  demos use lores but many have hires title screen etc -> free speed
  boost without quality loss (in theory..)
  
  Whats the catch? It is currently quite useless.
  - graphics subsystem needs to be reinitialized every time
    (=windowed mode recommended now..)
  - scaling is broken (blurring)
  - sound is restarted
  
  "autoscale"-checkbox will be removed in non-beta releases
  (but it will be available by manually editing config files)

- first implementation of uae-configuration-style control software
  that works outside of emulation (using named pipe \\.\pipe\WinUAE)
  
  currently working commands:

  - "CFG <config_entry> <config_value> [<another_entry>=<value>] .."
    change configuration on the fly
  - "CFG config_entry" return value of <config_entry>
  - "CFG beginning_of_config_entry*" return all config entries that
    beging with "begining_of_config_entry"
  - "EVT event event_value [more events]" send input event
    (inputevents.def in source archive, "KEY_A 1", "SPC_QUIT 1"..)
  
  return string is status code (http-style 3 digit status) +
  message-specific extra status.

  NOTE: Named pipes require Windows 2000 or newer. WIP.
  TODO: automatic notifications when configuration changes and more
  
  ipctester.exe (in separate archive) can be used to experiment with
  this feature.
  

Beta 1:

- improved C (trainer) debug command. Multiple searches supported
  (life counter = 3, "C 3", die, "C 2", more than one result?
  die again, "C 1" etc..) C without parameters resets the search.
  byte,word,3 byte,long integers supported. value < 256 = byte,
  value < 65536 = word etc.. "C <value> <size>" can be used to
  force type of value. (1-4). Added slow and fast memory support.
- fpu_strict config option added to GUI
- added Action Replay "fa <addr> [<saddr>] [<eaddr>]"-command to
  debugger
- started implementing "Input recorder". Only keyboard, joystick,
  mouse events supported. Don't try to change disk images.
  Record/playback buttons added to Output-panel.
  "Alt. playback mode" = more compatible but less accuracy.
  (debugging option currently) May not be too reliable yet. WIP.
  Please test and report. Usage: start recording, boot emulation
  or start recording and load state file. Same for playback.  
- build-in mousehack. MH code is now automatically started if
  "mousehack mouse" is selected from ports-panel, mousehack-Amiga
  side program is not needed anymore. MH C-code converted to asm
  and moved to filesys "boot rom". (filesys.asm)
- added disk label text box to "create standard adf"-option
  ("custom" adfs are unformatted)
- and finally the best new feature ever: drive sounds from PC floppy
  drive!... (requires driver from http://simonowen.com/fdrawcmd/)

1.2

Final: (official release date in 3-6 days)

- fpu_strict=yes/no config option added. yes = more accurate
  but slower. No GUI option yet.
- winuaelog.txt logging can be enabled or disabled on the fly
- another CIA keyboard handshake update. Previous update broke
  some intros with extremely weird keyboard routines..
- removed default mapping of PC PrintScreen key to Amiga key code
  0x6e (no special key should be visible to Amiga-side by default)
- winuaeenforcer update (BR)
- small tweak to "writing to BPLxPTL while bitplane DMA was
  accessing it at the same time" (unnamed intro by the Senses)
- it was not possible to delete directories in directory filesystem
  if recycle bin-setting was disabled. (broke in 5 and stupid me)
- windows recyclebin setting is on the fly adjustable
- OGL and D3D filters replaced with original versions, 1x-8x
  select boxes will be implemented later..

Beta 6:

- png screenshots (use "-screenshotbmp" command line parameter
  to force bmp screenshots. This will be removed in future.)
- FSGLMUL and FSGLDIV slowdown fix (PK)
- language selection added to misc-panel (user-specific, stored
  in registry, not in configuration file)
- disabled SHIFT+F12 debugger shortcut in fullscreen modes
- "final" translation dll included, no more changes to GUI.
- D3D/OGL scaling still broken... (so boring thing..)

Beta 5:

- fixed swapped parallel port joystick adapter firebuttons
- more FPU precision/rounding and other updates (Peter Keunecke)
- added improved sound filter code from uade (regular versions only,
  not "E"-versions) NOTE: only available when frequency is 44100Hz
- implemented internal light pen hardware (BPLCON0 bit 3 and VPOSR
  work now properly), mostly useless because there is no cursor or
  trigger yet..
- clicking on disabled drive's trackdisplay slot in windowed mode
  does not open disk dialog anymore
- switching adf read/write-status does not leave stale file locks
  open anymore
- apparently CIA TOD only stops when writing to TODHI and restarts
  when writing to TODLOW. Writing to TODMID does not stop it.
  (demo Harmony by Haujobb)

Beta 4:

- sprite DMA cycles are not anymore available for blitter or CPU
  in ce-mode (game Detonator, probably others too)
- some small ce-mode tweaks
- tweaked Sci-fi COPJMP-update, Thai Boxing works again.
  Copper stops (until next frame) only in following condition:
  - Copper DMA is disabled
  - Copper was waiting when DMA was disabled (this was missing)
  - both COPJMP1 and COPJMP2 were accessed while DMA is disabled
  -> Copper does not restart after DMA is re-enabled
- cycle-exact blitter line draw timing updates
- HAM enabled but only 4 bit planes enabled fixed (broke in B2)
- misc JIT cleanups (Peter Keunecke)
- D3D/OpenGL "works" now. Need some positioning fixes in
  lores/non-doubled modes.
- added AmiKit to about-panel

  I found something interesting about DMA slot allocation, the
  diagram in HRM is correct but there is 5 cycle offset.
  I used simple program that read DFF007 in tight loop (68060 A1200)
  and counted available horizontal positions. 4, 6, 8 and 10 is
  always unavailable (memory refresh). 18 = audio channel 0, 20, 22,
  24 channels 1-3. 26, 28 sprite 0, etc.. This leaves 12, 14 and 16
  for disk DMA (didn't bother to test because slots fit perfectly)
  Questions: Which one is the "real" value and which one is "fake"
  and why? Whats the reason for this unexplained delay? This does not
  affect DMA timing in UAE but CPU reads from DFF007 are not 100%
  correct. (this probably only affects really stupid wait routines)
  I will later use this same method to confirm copper's cycle usage.

Beta 3:

- doubleclicking on power-"led" in windowed mode opened multiple
  (broken) GUI windows
- display filter size and position formulas modified. old presets
  are not compatible. (D3D/OpenGL not yet updated, don't use)
- CIA-A keyboard handshake update, found another game (Wicked) that
  has "interesting" key handshaking code
- configuration save crash (B1, "Filtered Lores"-config entry was
  broken)
- display was shifted by one pixel to right if horizontal centering
  in lores-mode was enabled
- another priority-panel "Above Normal"-bug fixed..
- another FPU update from Peter Keunecke
- missed B1 changelog entry: overlay-checkbox is on the fly
  configurable

Beta 2:

- Logitech G15 LCD support complete (gfx by Jani Wilen)
- D3D filter works again
- ProWizard module ripper updated to latest version
- ignore MinSecondarySampleRate and MaxSecondarySampleRate when
  selected sample rate is 22050 <= x <= 44100 (found broken
  driver that reports 48000 as a min and max frequency..)
- more Amiga Forever 2005 path updates (incorrect paths if trailing
  / was missing from AMIGAFOREVERDATA-environment variable and in some
  situations ROM-path was incorrect)
- %-character fixed in debugger's memory dump
- sprite priorities and HAM change in mid horizontal line supported.
  Fixes Bubba'n'Stix second level background and Cover Girl Strip Poker
  title screen. May also fix demos/games with single incorrect horizontal
  line(s). Disposable Hero titlescreen is not fixed yet but looks slightly
  better.
- rare CE-mode bitplane/copper timing error (demo Green Surprise by Scoopex)
- horizontal cycles 0 to 3 (about) are visible in right border (for some
  reason horizontal blanking does not start at cycle 0), until now color
  changes were delayed until next horizontal line. Fixes wrong right
  border color in Leander, T-Racer, Unreal etc..

Beta 1:

- updated to final MSVC 2005
- sound in 4 channel mode created broken 2-channel wave-files
- added hdf creator to "add harddisk" panel, creates 1:1 hdf-image from
  selected Amiga formatted harddrive.
- harddisk check (RDB detect) crashed if drive's blocksize was >512.
  (does >512 physical block size block devices even exist?)
- FPU emulation update, rounding errors fixed, bad generation of NaNs,
  some missing constansts added. (Peter Keunecke, Bernd Roesch)
- JIT ACOS FPU bug really fixed (Peter Keunecke)
- switching from OCS to ECS or vice versa on the fly didn't reset
  "Arcadia Xenon"-fix correctly. Reboot is still needed to reset it.
- new horizontal shrinking mode, "Filtered lores" in GUI. New pixel is
  now average of two pixels instead of dropping every other pixel.
  Fixes incorrect colors in programs that use superhires tricks
  (for example Virtual Karting, demo Rest-2 by Codebusters) Also
  affects hires-screens if lores-checkbox is ticked. Does not work
  in 8-bit host mode.
- Logitech G15 keyboard LCD display support. WIP.
- overlay windowed window size was incorrect by 1 pixel
- GUI string update. WIP. (M.C. Battilana, TW)
- D3D filter is broken and crashes. Trying to fix another case of
  DLL hell.. (d3dx9_xx.dll)

1.1.1

Beta 3:

- don't set CIA-A FLAG-interrupt bit when program writes to parallel
  port without connected printer. Fixes Gauntlet III.
- editing filename or path from history list works again
- fps adjustment in display panel goes to 1 fps now (was 5)
- .uae extension in registry pointed to <data path>\WinUAE.exe, not
  <path to executable\WinUAE.exe. Caused only problems if -datapath
  command line parameter was used.

Beta 2:

- SPTI SCSI SCAN mode finally works properly. Also duplicate devices
  are now automatically removed.
  Big thanks to Frank Busse for testing, Cloanto for help and donating
  some SCSI stuff. and tiny thanks to me for bothering with
  installation of old SCSI stuff to my test PC, filling my small room
  with another PC, SCSI devices (old scanner I borrowed from work is
  huge and heavy) and wasting lots of time with testing and cursing bad
  documentation..
  This really took much longer than I originally thought. Only SCSI GUI
  panel to do and then SCSI subsystem is more or less finished.
- fixed yet another disk emulation bug. Reading from empty disk drive
  returned random data. "No disk in drive"-status was detected as
  drive with unformatted tracks. (Reading unformatted tracks must
  return random bits) Fixes Xybots. Bug was probably introduced after
  "Typhoon Thompson"-fix was implemented
- disk history select boxes' path separated from filename and moved to
  right side. Now filename is always visible even if path is very long.
  Yes, I know, it does not look too good but I didn't find any non-MFC
  custom multicolumn combo-box examples..

Beta 1:

- fixed incorrect AF2005 paths after clicking "reset to defaults"
- blitter could freeze in ce-mode if D-channel was not enabled
- separated GUI fullscreen resolution and depth selection
- do ASPI check only once and cache the results, check version
  of aspi dlls before enabling, nero aspi must be >=2 and adaptec
  aspi must be >= 4. No more bluescreens/crashes under W9x/me if
  using Windows build-in wnaspi32.dll crap.
- "floppy drive speed" and "new disk image" swapped in disk-panel
- extremely stupid bug in disk emulation fixed (broke in b10,
  may have caused disk detection problems with some games)
- SPTI-mode improved, re-enabled SCSI device scan ("SPTI + SCSI SCAN"
  in GUI. Separate option because driver bugs may cause problems..)
  SCSI scanners and tape drives should now work even without installed
  Windows driver. Note that WinUAE may detect SCSI devices twice in
  this mode (one from regular SPTI enumeration and the another from
  SCSI scan)

1.1

Beta 10: FINAL

- hardfile config loading bug if hardfile was missing
  (broke some versions ago)
- filesystem Examine(<root dir>) should return 2 (ST_USERDIR)
  instead of 1 (ST_ROOT) ST_ROOT isn't used. OFS, FFS and SFS
  also return ST_USERDIR. (and Guru Book says ST_ROOT isn't used)
  This fixes some (buggy?) file checking routines.
- fixed really stupid diskrdy-signal bug (broke in 0990b6..)

Beta 9:

- added "non-path" Kickstart ROM mode in config files.
  (useful for frontend-type programs etc..)
  Syntax:
  kickstart_rom=v<ver>[.<rev>] [r<subver>.<subrev>] [<model>]
  Only <ver> is mandatory. Model must be specified if requested
  ROM file is not a regular Kickstart ROM.
  Examples:
  v1.3 (select any autodetected 1.3)
  v1.2 r33.166 (must be KS1.2 revision 33.166)
  v1.2 A500 (KS1.2 rev 33.180)
  v2.05 A600HD (KS 2.05, rev 37.350 or 37.300)
  v3.1 r40.68 A1200 (KS 3.1 rev 40.68 A1200)
  v3.1 r40.68 (KS 3.1 rev 40.68, both A1200 or A4000 version allowed)
  v3.1;v3.0 (any revision of KS 3.1 or 3.0)
  v3 A1200 (A1200 KS 3.1 or 3.0)
  v2 AR (any Action Replay v2)
  Multiple matches: highest available version is selected
  Extended ROM config item: kickstart_ext_rom=
  Cartridge ROM config item: cart=
  Arcadia ROMs:
  cart=Arcadia <name>, for example cart=Arcadia Xenon
- CIA INMODE=3 normally equals INMODE=2 (CIA serial port clock pin
  is normally high while idle) Fixes game Warp
- "bad hardfile"-messages replaced with something slightly better
  (can't be translated yet)
- added support for amigaforever.dll (optional rom.key alternative)
- compressed hardfiles supported. current restrictions:
  - max 100M (whole hardfile will be kept uncompressed in memory)
  - all written data will be lost after reseting or exiting WinUAE
  - hardfile filename extension must be hdz,zip,rar or 7z
- hardfiles can be dragndropped to harddisk-panel
- statefiles with Action Replay work again (broke in 0.9.90)
- OCS/ECS Amiga colorspace translation to native color space was
  not completely correct (I guess since the beginning..) for example
  0xfff was translated to 0xf0f0f0, not 0xffffff (basically this makes
  OCS/ECS modes slightly brighter)

Beta 8:

- ACTION_COPY_DIR_FH fix (it was totally broken..)
- Disk Swapper: right button doubleclick in "Disk image"-column:
  removes disk in disk swapper panel. right button singleclick in
  "Drive"-column: remove disk in drive
- CAPS -> SPS renaming here and there..

Beta 7:

- modifying directory's protect or comment changed its modification
  time. Previous update failed to handle directories properly.
  (CreateFile() to dir needs FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS flag. urgh.)
- tweaked "Bubba'n'Stix / Battle Squadron sprite update". It broke
  Elfmania's scoreboard. Now all 3 games run without gfx bugs.
- JIT-checkbox remembers previous JIT cache size
- improved switching from cycle-exact mode to non-cycle-exact (or
  vice versa). Previously switching modes may have resulted in frozen
  emulated software (missing blitter finished flag/interrupt)
- simple copper debugger implemented. Breakpoint, trace and vpos/hpos
  of executed copper commands (vpos/hpos-feature was already
  implemented but it needed to be activated in compile-time)
  New commands:
  - ob <addr> = breakpoint (not 100% exact yet)
  - ot = single step
  - o0 = disassemble from current address 
- Arcadia World Trophy Soccer (MAME 0.99u8, ar_socc.zip) supported
- "desktop smaller than windowed window"-check was incorrect
- SPTI direct SCSI-adapter enumeration disabled until code has been
  fully tested (currently it is mostly useless)

Beta 6:

- tweak to undocumented "switching bitplane DMA on during DDF"-feature
  (Death Trap flashing score board. Semi-broken copperlist again..)
- SPTI CDROM support was broken in b5
- Priority panel's active priority was broken in b5
- sprite update updated. Fixes CD32 "key" in nvram screen. (0992b4)
  OCS/ECS: sprite is attached if odd or even sprite's SPRxCTL bit 7
  is set. AGA: odd sprite SPRxCTL bit 7 only.

Beta 5:

- some 68000 prefetch special case tweaks 
- some cycle-exact blitter tweaks
- replaced ASPI-checkbox with select box (SPTI, AdaptecASPI, NeroASPI)
- updated to latest zlib
- SCSI tape drives and scanners are not filtered anymore in ASPI-mode
  (-noaspifiltering parameter is not needed anymore)
- another SPTI-mode non-CDROM support improvement (not finished yet)
- delay possible forced rom scan until GUI is opened
- replaced "delayoffset" tables with proper(?) algorithm. (Loons Docs)
- added "none" to joystick/mouse selectbox
- improved Amiga Forever 2005 path handling
- added AF2005/AF/WinUAE default paths -select box. Only visible if
  user has more than one installation (for example AF 2005 and plain
  WinUAE)
- directory filesystem ACTION_COPY_DIR_FH (DosPacket) implemented
  (AmigaDOS function DupLockFromFH()) No idea why this one was missed..
- added address-parameter to debugger i-command (overrides VBR)
- updated and cleaned "disable bitplane dma if planes > maxplanes".
  It isn't that simple. OCS/ECS, lores and planes set to 7 -> number
  of planes is 4. DMA gets disabled only if number of planes is larger
  than available DMA slots, for example OCS/ECS hires and > 4 planes.
  (demo Spanish Rose by Creed)
- fixed buggy COPJMP fix in 1.0b6. Broke for example Obliterator intro.

Beta 4:

- blitter blockmode update, this time I did lots of testing with real
  Amiga. Results are quite interesting.. (more notes in blitter.c)
  fixes: many demos with flickering or partially clipped objects
- last line was missing in programmed interlaced display modes
- DIVU/DIVS division by zero exception return address fix
  (broke in b1, reorganized code too much..)
- set JIT have_rat_stall (broken in b1 CPU detection code update)
- native code slowdown workaround (BR)

Beta 3:

- fixed incorrect paths if running WinUAE from network drive
- Paths-panel "Reset to defaults" forces reload of configuration file
  directory
- AHI works again (broken in b2)
- don't call init_hz() every frame if interlaced programmed display
  mode is enabled (for example interlaced Euro36)
- screen vertical starting position properly calculated in programmed
  modes (horizontal pos is much more complex, later or never..)
- many programmed mode registers were saved as zeros to statefile
  (also debugger e-command showed wrong contents)
- updated to latest archiveaccess.dll. Library is used to support rar
  and 7z archives. I'd prefer internal support but it seems rar's
  license prevents it and (at least last time I checked) 7z-support
  routines were unreadable mess..

Beta 2:

- "genlock connected" GUI option added. Please continue reading before
  saying I am crazy :)
  Kickstart's genlock detection code always detected genlock due to not
  emulated ERSY-bit in BPLCON0. Normally it does not really matter but
  most non-video frequency compatible monitor drivers don't load if
  genlock is connected. (and currently most of them work very strangely
  because not all programmable sync registers are used to calculate the
  position of screen) GUI option is basically only for backwards
  compatibility.
- Fast Copper removed (Bernd#1) It is too broken..
- removed now useless mod ripper from debugger
- added more missing unused keycodes to inputevents.def, updated CDTV
  CD player keycodes
- MMKeyboard support added (http://www.geit.de/eng_mmkeyboard.html) (BR)
- AHI recording memory leak (BR)
- special WinUAE qualifier key (END) is now configurable (currently
  the only way is to manually edit the keycode in config file, config
  entry is called win32.specialkey)
- transparent "led status bar"
- in windowed mode window height (Amiga display area's height) was not
  correct in some cases (for example 200 was changed to 208)
- "Add PC Drives at Startup"-option adds only local drives, added
  separate checkbox for network drives
- default to MultiMediaTimers instead of Sleep() if both have good enough
  time resolution (previously defaulted to Sleep())
- AmigaSYS added to About-box
- CD32 mode enabled: map CD32 buttons to compatibility-mode joystick
- Keyboard led mode-configuration option added (can't be autodetected
  properly)
- zlib statically linked (90kb is nothing..), zlib1.dll is not needed
  anymore
- merged CPU detection code from BasiliskII JIT (64-bit updates coming
  later)
- added non-CDROM SCSI device support to SPTI-mode. May not work
  because I don't have any real SCSI devices.. Check the log between
  "Scan starts..." and "finished." and send reports.
  NOTE: Order of CDROMs (if you have more than one) may change because
  drive letters aren't used anymore. SCSI GUI-panel will be implemented
  later..

Beta 1:

- zipped encrypted roms didn't always decrypt properly
- rom/disk image maximum allowed path size increased
- improved catweasel mouse/joystick support (separate input devices
  instead of hardcoded input layout) NOTE: MK3 can't read joystick
  buttons 2 and 3 without installed SID-chip. Catweasel is now always
  enabled if detected. Checkbox in misc-panel is only used to enable
  Catweasel ZorroII-card emulation (floppy access)
  NOTE2: right and middle mouse button may not work on every Amiga
  mice. This will be fixed in future Catweasel core update.
- ACOS FPU fix (fixes broken particles in "Fake Electronic Lightshow"
  by Ephidrena, broke in previous FPU update) (Peter Keunecke)
- left click don't capture mouse anymore if GUI is active
- Picasso96 graphics problem introduced in 1.0
- lots of 64-bit compilation errors fixes (non-JIT version already
  works, also it is possible to have max 2G of Z3Fast in 64-bit
  version.. pointless but fun..)
- more stable on the fly configuration loading
- added exact 68000 DIVU and DIVS cycle usage algorithm (ce-mode only)
- stackmagic is 64-bit compatible (argh, that took ages to fix..)
- replaced inline assembly stackmagic-space allocation with _alloca()
  (compatible with both 32 and 64-bit compilers)
- bsdsocket emulation 64-bit fix (may have caused breakage, bsdsock.c
  did have some quite "interesting" code that needed complete rewrite...)

Not yet 64-bit compatible:

- JIT (Basilisk II have 64-bit compatible JIT)
- native code support
- inline asm helper functions in ahidsound.c (inline assembly is not
  allowed in 64-bit mode..) First task is to add C-versions and add
  64-bit assembler versions later if really needed.
- not all external libraries or devices are available in 64-bit yet
  (Catweasel drivers, CAPSImg.dll, ArchiveAccess.dll, gsdll32.dll)
  64-bit zlib.dll is included.
- asm-optimized filters default to C-code in 64-bit mode (which means
  scale2x etc.. are probably slower in 64-bit)

1.0 (06.06.2005)

Beta 10: (final)

- FSINCOS-FPU instruction with identical destination registers
  fix (Peter Keunecke)
- fixed graphics corruption (shifted bitplane) if BPLxPTL was
  written and bitplane DMA accessed it exactly at the same time.
  Fixes intros "3v Demo" by Cave and "New Year Demo" by Phoenix

Beta 9:

- changing write protection status of command-line inserted disks
  failed to reinsert the disk properly
- added optimized JIT FPU trigonometric functions (Peter Keunecke)
- added directory filesystem speed up-patch (BR+me)

Beta 8:

- SPTI SCSI-mode sense-key handling fix. Some systems failed to
  detect media ("Drive empty" in log) Bug since the beginning..
- recompiled with MSVS 2005B2. Faster? Slower? Unstable?
  (experimental 64-bit versions coming after 1.0 is out)
- Windows 98/ME(?) SHGetFolder-error fixed
- catweasel direct io is back (there is no new drivers for MK1)
  Direct io is enabled if catweasel-config option is larger or
  equal than 100
- default translation dll included

Beta 7:

- debugger 'H'-command fixed and improved.
  H=disassembly only, HH=disassembly+full cpu state. Command
  only works while debugger is active (for example one or more
  breakpoints are enabled)
- GUI's screenshot option does not capture the GUI anymore
  (happened in D3D/OpenGL and non-overlayed modes)
- added test for installed rtg.library version
  (it seems too many users don't know about updated library)
- X-Arcade layout tooltip re-added
- .uae-extension is stored to user-specific registry if user
  is running in non-admin account (NT-based Windows only)
- audio reverse stereo option added
- [development PC updated to 64-bit Windows XP. I'll try first
  64-bit build (without JIT) when free MSVS 2005 Beta 2 arrives]

Beta 6:

- active priority was not set until window lost and reacquired focus
- winuaenforcer updated. "winuaeenforcer 1" cause all illegal
  adress read or write from 0-$100 or unused amigamem an illegal
  adress Exception 3. (BR)
- b5 only worked on Windows XP (nobody is using 98/ME or 2K anymore?)
- implemented undocumented COPJMP-feature (game Sci-fi)
- Marvin's Marvellous Adventure works again in JIT-mode
- disk read/write debugging option (see debugger help)
- added sample ripper (in output-panel) Samples are dumped to
  screenshots-directory. Duplicates are ignored automatically.
- "save as wav" statefile option (for easy manual sample hunting)

Beta 5:

- fixed possible crash while restoring saved state (broken in b1)
- proper natmem-allocation update (W2K/XP only)
- fixed "Couldn't load Kickstart"-message while loading older
  statefiles (b1)
- Tenebra (AGA demo) "face"-part partial fix (missing 3d-object
  is now visible) Top and bottom parts of face are still missing
- added Windows CPU info (32/64-bit and revision levels) to
  winuaebootlog.txt

Beta 4:

- disk step rate limit improved. For example Music disk Extemporized
  by Digital (and some other Digital products) do two very quick
  steps that must not be ignored. It is really far too quick but it
  still works.. (but most likely some drives don't like it..)
  And of course there ARE demos that do very very quick steps that
  must be ignored..
- Battle Squadron hiscore-sprite update, 3rd letter of player's
  name was not visible in hiscore-screen, also fixes Bubba'n'Stix's
  jumpy background mountains.
- compatibility filesystem and hardfile -config entries are back
  (not sure why or when they disappeared..)
- added filesystem "no recyclebin"-option to harddrive-panel
- "Catweasel"-checkbox is now disabled if CW driver or card is not
  detected
- Catweasel MK3 Windows driver support fixed and confirmed working
  (Can anyone with MK1 test?) 
- ASPI-mode now automatically uses Nero ASPI if Nero Burning ROM is
  installed (Demo or full version) Nero ASPI has much better
  compatibility than Adaptec's crap... Detected ASPI is shown in log
- joystick/mouse selection GUI changed again (tooltips not fixed yet)
- rare load crash fixed
- fullscreen mode resolution reset when using resolutions where y > x
- loading preset filter didn't update the screen

Beta 3:

- changing Amiga-specific protection flags or comment changed also
  file's modification date. (broke in 0.9.92 FS update) 
- simple config file backup, config file is renamed to
  "configuration.backup" before it is overwritten or deleted
- Windows 9x/ME didn't like new natmem-allocation system,
  so now only NT-based Windows' use new system
- Picasso96's autoconfig config area RAM size was always 8M when
  configured size was 8M or larger.. (bug since the beginning..)
- enforcer bug fix (BR)
- removed filesystem automatic read-only check, apparently it is
  impossible to detect read/write status of network drives
  (and 100% sure detection of networked drives is also too complex..)

Beta 2:

- DMA accesses to upper 512kb of chip RAM with only 512k chip RAM
  and 1MB Agnus installed don't map to low 512kb like CPU accesses do.
  Fixes Arcadia SideWinder (game bug, bogus blitter d-channel address)
- added AmigaForever ROM path autodetection to ROM scanner
- added workaround for AMOS filesystem emulation incompatibility
  (infinite loop in filesystem code) Reason for freeze unknown,
  proper fix unknown.. (filesystem emulation is confusing..)
- compatible with Arcadia MAME 0.90u4 ROM update
- "Kickstart v1.2 (A1000)" was not detected because of wrong CRC32..
- joystick axis/buttons were marked non-mappable to mousebuttons,
  fixed
- natmem-area allocation changed slightly (allocation is still buggy
  because there is race condition that can cause allocation to
  fail in some rare cases but fixing this properly isn't so simple)
- SPC_INCREASE_REFRESHRARE -> SPC_INCREASE_REFRESHRATE...
- adjusting keyboard leds and then entering to any panel except
  priority panel reset all priority values to "Above Normal" (and
  I thought this was 100% fixed some releases ago..)
- fixed Picasso96 freeze/crash/bogus refreshrates if display-panel
  "parenthesized" refresh rate was selected.
- relative kickstart/floppy/hdf paths work properly again
- misc disk swapper-panel updates
- enforcer update (BR)
- keyboard layout C: both numpad 5 and 2 is mapped to down
- bsdsocket update (SR) (don't open connection dialog if
  requested address is localhost)
- Catweasel support now requires Windows driver (no more direct port
  access) New official Windows driver will be released very soon.
  Added Catweasel enable-checkbox to misc-panel

Beta 1:

- bsdsocket emulation could crash in some cases (SR)
- exception 3 update in 0.9.90b6 was buggy, broke Shinobi, Double
  Dragon 2 and probably others..
- Arcadia arcade system emulation (MAME 0.90 Arcadia roms supported)
  Configuration: basic A500 setting (KS1.3, 0.5M Chip etc..)
  Point "Cartridge ROM File" to Arcadia ROM file (ar_????.zip)
  Start emulation.
  Default key shortcuts: F2 = diagnostics menu,
  1 = start 1 player game, 2 = 2 player game, 5 = coin slot 1,
  6 = coin slot 2 (configurable in input-panel)
- audio channels were swapped (no idea when or if they ever have been
  correct..)
- Picasso96 DOpus 4.12-problem fix (BR)
- debugger improvements:
  - r sr xx = change status register
  - r ccr xx = change condition codes (low 5 bits of SR only)
  - r usp/isp/msp xx = change stack pointers
  - r vbr xx = change VBR
  - sc = screenshot
- filesystem configuration (mountinfo) data handling rewrite. This
  should finally fix random crashes when reloading new config (or
  changing quickstart model settings) on the fly. Note that changed
  harddrive settings are only activated after reset instead of
  immediately (which usually resulted in confused AmigaOS..)
- switching from catweasel-enabled to non-cw-enabled configuration
  on the fly caused crash (I forgot to reset catweasel options..)
- added history list/text edit box to disk swapper


0.9.92

Beta 8: (final. official release date: tuesday/wednesday)

- setting number of bitplanes (BPLCON0) larger than max supported
  caused incorrect blitter and copper timing. Fixes intro
  "First Anniversary" by "Lazy Bones"
- refresh is now forced to every frame if cycle-exact is enabled

Beta 7:

- fixed AHI bug introduced in b6
- fixed AVIOutput bug that lost every other frame when recording
  interlaced screen modes and linedoubling was enabled
- HD size detection improved. In some cases larger harddrives'
  detected size was slightly smaller than real size. This was due
  to using "wrong" Windows size-detection IOCTL, unfortunately the
  better one is Windows XP/Windows Server 2003-only routine...
  (IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY and IOCTL_DISK_GET_LENGTH_INFO)
- Picasso96 optimization (Bernd Roesch)

Beta 6:

- fixes memory corruption/crash if using >1024 pixels wide 32bit
  chipset display mode without filters
- changed default active priority from "Above normal" to "Normal"
  (yeah, I changed my mind, again..)
- fixed beta 4 and 5 disk insert problems
- added windowed mode "Always on top"-checkbox to misc-panel
- WinUAE now uses multiuser-aware Windows language settings for
  selecting GUI translation DLL instead of using old-style system
  default setting
- replaced really weird and incorrect AddTail()-function in
  picasso96.c with correct version (20 lines of code -> 4 lines..)
- non-ce-mode blitter timing bug fixed (broken in 0823b2..)
- ce-mode slowdown introduced in b4 optimized

Beta 5:

- Quickstart disk insert fixed (broke in b4 multiselect support)
- X-Arcade updated mappings
- internal drive click sound fixed (broke in b4)
- last swapper position was unavailable (and b4 again)
- some printing tweaks
- image tool tip support (currently only used for X-Arcade keyboard
  layout, image and mappings by Pierre Astruc)
- compiled with updated zlib headers and library (1.2.2)
- onscreen floppy and HD leds flash red while writing
- window close-button is now working if "Use CTRL+F11 to quit"
  is enabled
- fixed random disk read errors when writing and immediately reading
  same track back in non-turbo mode (broke in 0.8.26 or so, fixes
  SuperDuper formatting, also probably fixes some save disk formatting
  problems)

Beta 4:

- cycle-exact copper/bitplane fix (may cause some slowdown, sorry..)
- improved drive click emulation, requires big external sample file
  Samples maybe compressed and included inside winuae.exe in future.
  (James Bagg)
- fixed drive click GUI external sample detection
- another sprite emulation update (intro "Da blue mouse" by Vectra)
  Sprite attachment must be active if sprite's attachment-bit is
  set, even if odd sprite pair is not "armed"
- added soft and hard reset input-targets
- fixed sprite problem introduced in beta 3
- added keycodes to keyboard input source list
- added configurable print job flush timer
  0 = disabled, >0 = automatically close printer handle after
  parallel port has been idle x seconds (workaround for
  Windows 2000/XP never ending print jobs)
- fps adjustment GUI support added
- fixed really stupid mistake, input-panel autofire always said
  "yes", even if autofire wasn't enabled. I guess this happened
  when yes/no was added to translation.
- bsdsocket update, fixes Newsrog (SR)
- X-Arcade build-in keyboard layouts added (tooltips still missing)
- disk-image dialog multiselect support
  (Quickstart, Disk Drives and Disk Swapper)

Beta 3:

- and another incorrect "SWIV-fix" side-effect fixed
  (intro "Inspiration Is None" by Anarchy)
- GUI window close button or ALT-F4 fixed
- config-load command line parameters now load hardware and host-
  configurations properly
- CIA PBON/TOGGLE-bits emulated (fixes really weird copy protection)
- last 4 scanlines were invisible in filtered modes
- "Pause emulation" when inactive paused immediately after emulation
  was started, clear CPU% and FPS when entering pause-mode, more
  logical GUI operation with "Pause emulation" and "Disable sound
  output" -checkboxes.
- sprite tweaks, Superfrog intro bees, SuperStardust AGA tunnel section
  and Kefrens Pharaos Fantasy -intro's scroller (Superfrog and
  SuperStardust updates are quite logical but Kefrens fix looks slightly
  illogical which means something may break..)
- copper/blitter timing tweaks

Beta 2:

- demo Nivel by Banal Projects works properly again
  (demo triggered "SWIV-fix")
- archiveaccess multiarchive support (only 7z, rar and zip currently
  enabled) Archiveaccess + 7z plugins are in separate archive
  (experimental, may be removed if better solution is found)
- all DLLs from WinUAE's directory can be moved to directory called
  "plugins"
- PostScript detection corrupted PostScript data if start marker was
  %!PS<something here> instead of %!PS<linefeed>
- hardfile creation improved. Create-button is only enabled if size
  is set, added dostype selection. It is now easy to create regular
  non-RDB SFS-hardfiles, simply create SFS-hardfile, point
  FileSystem-path to SmartFilesystem-filesystem handler and use
  SFSFormat to format it
- postscript settings can be changed on the fly
- serial port direct-setting can be changed on the fly
- fixed incorrect initialization of user-defined drive sounds
- reset GUI's coordinates to top-left of desktop if original location
  is not visible on any monitor
- disk image bootable check didn't ignore non-zero sector headers
  (for example Second Samurai ipf-image was rejected)
- screenshot-files are now named <name of image in df0>_xxx.bmp
  (or xxx.bmp if df0: is empty)

Beta 1:

- generic GUI custom key shortcut support added
- disk swapper GUI panel key shortcuts added:
  cursor up/down = move cursor
  SHIFT + cursor up/down = move cursor & selected disk image
  cursor right = change drive (DF0->DF1->DF2->DF3->DF0)
  return = select image
  del = remove image
  CTRL + 1-4 = change drive (direct)
  ALT + number = jump to line 1-10
  SHIFT + ALT + number = jump to line 11 - 20
- harddisk key short cuts added
  (cursor up/down and shift, enter and delete)
- implemented generic GUI mouse listview drag'n'drop
- disk swapper and harddrives up/down arrow-images removed (looked
  quite ugly with Windows XP styles..), replaced with drag'n'drop
- automatically map developer/beta KS ROMs at 0x200000
  (if chipram size <= 0x200000 and fast ram is not enabled)
- cycle-exact plus frameskip enabled does not affect internal timing
  anymore (but frameskip in ce-mode isn't as fast in older versions)
- speed (refresh rate) adjustment implemented in non-vsync modes.
  no gui-support yet but END+SHIFT+numpad -/+ can be used to
  increase/decrease speed
- graphics corruption in NakuDemo by Vision-X fixed (demo is OCS-only)
- updated AHI driver, fixes record bug when ahi_minbufflen was set
  to any other value than default 2. (Bernd Roesch)
- Stardust (non-AGA) starwars-scroller ce-mode blitter bug fix
- non-JIT fastest possible/CPUvsChipset-option fixed
- remove harddrives when setting quickstart configuration
- entering quickstart for the first time used default host-settings,
  not (possible) user-selected host-settings configuration file
- CompaVsCPU-slider was sometimes reset to leftmost position
- experimental non-GUI disk swapper shortcuts added,
  END+1-0 (not numeric keypad) = insert image from swapper slot 1-10
  END+SHIFT+1-0 = insert image from swapper slot 11-20
  END+CTRL+1-4 = select drive
  What about preferred drive selection in GUI for all slots?
- regular HDF TD_GETGEOMETRY now returns user-entered HDF parameters
  instead of "guessed" values
- filesystem bug fix (0.9.90/0.9.91), files with Windows System or
  Hidden -flag set didn't open properly in all cases. (another
  Windows feature..)

- filesystem protection flag, comment and Windows illegal character
  handling update, UAEFSDB-information is now stored in file's named
  stream called "_UAEFSDB.___". (=works 100% transparently, no more
  separate UAEFSDB-files) New mode is only used if current directory
  has no old __UAEFSDB_-file and filesystem is NTFS.
  
  *** TESTING IS NEEDED! ***

- "flush print job" button works now properly
- PostScript printer emulation. It is now possible to print
  directly from WinUAE to any Windows-supported printer.
  (except if program does not use printer.device and it doesn't have
  build-in PostScript-support)

  1: install Ghostscript (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/)
  2: tick "PostScript printer emulation" in WinUAE settings
  (grayed out checkbox = no Ghostscript gsdll32.dll detected)
  3: boot to Workbench and select PostScript printer driver
  4: print normally
  (thanks to Borg No. One for inspiration and testing)


0.9.91

Beta 3:

- priority level and systray menu translation dll support fixed
- translation DLL load problems fixed
- disable quickstart-mode if using -f or -config= -command
  line parameters
- bsdsocket update, fixes ~2 second pause on some systems and
  added internet connection off-line check (Stephen Riedelbeck)

Beta 2:

0.9.91 will be released next weekend (or so) because of dangerous
filesystem bug (files can be truncated to zero, originally, for
some reason, I didn't think it was that dangerous problem..)
No new features except possible quick bug fixes to do.

- added right alt = firebutton to keyboard layout B (right ctrl is
  kept for compatibility) Many laptops don't have right ctrl nor
  numpad.. (was in b1 but changelog entry was missed)
- CPU idle calculation update (based on Bernd Roesch's idea) you may
  need to readjust your CPU Idle-setting
- ALT-TAB updates (again..) Direct3D+GUI enabled ALT-TAB seems to
  work now (or not)
- Picasso96 screen is properly refreshed when GUI is active (except
  in fullscreen mode but I don't know to fix it without overwriting
  the GUI window..)
- non-existing paths automatically defaults to WinUAE's directory
- uae-configuration fixes and changes. for example:
  "uae-configuration cpu*" lists all config entries that start
  with "cpu"
- fixed Picasso96 CTRL-ALT-DEL to login screen and ESC -> black screen
- one more open file filesystem bug fix
- and another blitter non-ce/non-immediate speed fix (it didn't really
  do anything since beta 13.. PPHammer and Spindizzy Worlds work again
  without flashing)

Beta 1

- directory hardfile: added more commands that flash hd led
- some improvements to JIT crash preventer
- missing translation strings added (priority levels, compatible
  and turbo -floppy speeds, yes/no in input autofire and harddrive
  emulation read-only status)
- updated Overkill AGA fix (Alien Breed II AGA scrolling)
- filesystem fixes. Read-only files didn't open, some error codes
  were wrong and opening file in readwrite-mode truncated it
- BorderBlank-bit is in ECS-Denise and newer chipsets (was AGA-only)
- loading config didn't set correct stereo separation variables
  if separation was set but delay wasn't. fixed.
- Latest SFS changelog says "ACTION_ADD_NOTIFY now returns
  ERROR_BAD_NUMBER if the notification is neither a NRF_SEND_MESSAGE
  nor a NRF_SEND_SIGNAL notification." Filesystem emulation does
  the same thing now.
- added uae-configuration Amiga-side program, it is basically very
  extended uae-control. It has 3 modes:
  1: without parameters it outputs all current configuration settings
  2: with single parameter it outputs value of config entry
  example: "uae-configuration cpu_type" -> "68040"
  3: with two (or more) parameters it can change configuration and
  send input events on the fly.
  examples: "uae-configuration cachesize 0" (disable JIT) or
  "gfx_vsync true gfx_refreshrate 50" (enable vsync and set refresh
  rate to 50) "SPC_ENTERGUI 1" (open GUI), "KEY_A 1 KEY_A 0" (press
  and release A-key) etc.. Check inputevents.def (in source archive)
  for all supported events.
  Return codes: 0 = ok, 5 = config name not found, 10 = other error,
  20 = not supported (too old UAE)
- automatic rom-scan check improved, no more forced scanning if user
  run older WinUAE versions without rom-scan support


Final 0.9.90:

- floppy speed was never initialized to 100% in quickstart-mode
- default.uae ignored paths-panel configurations-path
- in some circumstances regular configuration was saved to
  hardware or host configuration directory
- enabling/disabling lores on the fly didn't always reset all
  internal variables correctly resulting in weird display

RC1:

- back2roots URL updated (was ancient http://back2roots.emuunlim.com/),
  abime.net URL added
- fixed uninitialized variable that may have caused problems in
  4-channel sound mode
- possible crash bug in beta13's blitter update fixed
- game-port panel joystick compatibility with older config files fixed
  (why is kbd1 = first keyboard layout but joy0 = first joystick?)

Beta 13:

- changed quickstart uae-config's floppy speed to turbo
- MOVEC control register 0x804 was incorrectly marked as 68040-only,
  but it really is 68020+. It seems I broke this in some 0.8.22 version
  without anyone noticing it.. (fixes AIBB crash in 68020-mode)
- directory filesystem deleted files/directories are now moved to
  Windows Recycle Bin (if RB is not disabled)
- release all inputdevices when entering debugger (and acquire them
  again after exiting) Fixes keyboard freeze on some Windows 2000
  systems
- last entry in Ports-panel mouse/joystick-selectbox was unselectable
- middle mouse button didn't work, stupid typo in b12's input cleanup
- removed "Windows mouse" mousewheel and number of buttons limits, there
  are programs that can send for example faked middle button messages
  even if real mouse has only 2 buttons etc..
- "Windows mouse" middle button = ALT-TAB fix
- disable quickstart media-check if quickstart-checkbox is not checked
- yet another active/inactive/minimized-fix
- added image+crc tooltip to df0-df3 windowed mode "leds"
  btw, for some reason SB_SETTEXT's SBT_POPOUT-mode don't do anything if
  non-classic skin in Windows XP is selected. (which means "leds" don't
  move "up" or "down") Any ideas?
- left click on status bar df0-df3 = insert disk, right click = eject,
  left click on power = gui, right click = reset. Left and right button
  doubleclicks are still free if someone needs more functions :)
- blitter non-ce/non-immediate approximate slowdown due to bitplane dma
  -code changed
- add support for other german keyboard layouts

Beta 12:

- "Syncronize clock"-feature is back, fixed random turbo clock
- gameport configuration defaults fixed
- added "4 Channel" audio mode (=feed all 4 Amiga channels directly
  to DirectSound device without 4->2 software mixing, was earlier only
  available with "-dsaudiomix" command line parameter)
- "Crux"-interpolation with stereo separation enabled fixed
  (readjustment of stereo separation GUI-settings are needed)
- show message if there is no Kickstart ROM selected and Kickstart
  replacement fails to run disk image in df0: (previous versions
  simply returned to GUI without saying anything..)
- "Could not load Kickstart ROM"-message readded (not sure why or when
  it disappeared..)
- kickstart replacement wasn't enabled if no Kickstart ROM was
  selected, but it worked if selected ROM couldn't be loaded.. fixed.
- input device renaming must be of course after sorting, not before..
- Added "Amiga 2000" to Amiga 500 model-title
- mousehack-support changed, mousehack-mode is only enabled when
  Amiga-side mousehack-program is running and new special
  "Mousehack mouse" is selected. Autoselecting mousehack-mode would
  have caused too many unsolvable problems. Without mousehack-program
  mousehack-mode works just like "Windows mouse"
- mousehack works in fullscreen mode. (=tablets work in fullscreen)
- quickstart only autosets configuration when "start in quickstart-mode"
  -checkbox is checked. "Set Configuration"-button can be used to
  set the config when checkbox is not checked.
- dragndrop rom type detection
- cd32-pad emulation improved, should be nearly perfect now,
  also default joystick/joypad cd32-button mappings changed
  (removed useless "firebutton") (CD32 pad info from schematic at:
  http://home.t-online.de/home/malibann/cd32gamepad/cd32gamepad.html)
- cd32 cdrom drive is now always redetected after every reset
- keyboard layout A/B/C compatibility with older versions fixed
  (check and resave your configs)
- changed default windowed resolution to 720x568

Beta 11: hopefully only bugs fixes left..

- improved game controller/mouse selection in "Game & IO-ports",
  even multimouse is now possible without need to use input-panel
  (but don't forget OS limits: 98/ME = two USB mice required,
  2000 = no multimouse support, XP = no mouse limits)
- changed naming of input devices with identical names
  (first is named "xxx [1]", second "xxx [2]" etc..)
- removed some REALLY obsolete win32-specific filesystem filename
  mangling functions. (for example ~ in file names didn't work)
  Testing needed!
- Action Replay freeze-key (page up) was unavailable for configuration
  even if Action Replay was not enabled, fixed. Again.
- USB keyboard led-support (may not work in all cases yet)
- more ALT-TAB fixes (this is so stupid, for example Direct3D-
  fullscreen mode sends minimized information differently than other
  regular DirectDraw fullscreen modes..)
- added "Windows Mouse" buttons 4 and 5, detect the real number of
  "Windows Mouse" buttons and wheel. NOTE: non-DirectInput maximum
  number of supported buttons is 5 (Windows 2000/XP) or 3 (9x/ME)
- added default mapping of mouse buttons 4 and 5 to ALT+CURSOR LEFT
  and ALT+CURSOR RIGHT (back and forward)
- it is now possible to dragndrop disk image(s) directly to any drive's
  path-string box

Beta 10b:

- "automatic" jump back to fullscreen after ALT-TAB fixed, I think..
- changed TD_GETGEOMETRY slightly, use CHS-values from RDB if RDB
  is detected, only "invent" the values if RDB is not detected.
- paths-panel manual path editing fixed
- flash ram manual editing fixed

Beta 10: lots of small things..

- Action Replay 2 and 3 ROM first 4 byte tweak, dumping the ROM under
  UAE (pointless?) results now exactly the same dump as on real A500
- debugger tracing commands didn't work in ROM
- added automatic KS patcher that disables A4000T ROM's
  "NCR scsi.device" -> A4000T ROM is back and working. (A4000T NCR
  scsi.device expects correct scsi hardware -> no hardware -> confused
  driver -> infinite loop..) Maybe pointless too but...
- some A500<>A1000<>CDTV<>CD32 on the fly switching bugs fixed
- 68020/68EC020-KS check didn't work correctly if
  shapeshifter-patch was enabled, fixed
- fixed possible crash when ALT-TABing from filtered fullscreen mode
- crash when saving new config and no old config file has been selected
- fixed corrupt logical disk format when creating standard 3.5"HD ADF
  (this has been broken since the beginning..)
- added TD_GETGEOMETRY (very rarely needed) support to uaehf.device
- optimized stereo separation/mixing algorithm, fixed incorrect config
  file entry name ("sound_stereo_mixing" -> "sound_stereo_mixing_delay")
- added missing KS 37.299 ROM in A600-ROM scan check
- don't touch WinUAE version number in registry if it is newer than
  current
- Quickstart "Host Configuration"-checkbox didn't remember previously
  selected configuration.
- added some example host configurations (800x600 and 640x480
  fullscreen and one windowed). I plan to add these and maybe some
  other (suggestions?) host-configurations with release version.
  (it will be optional component in installer)
- added configuration link selector and probably confusing
  ignore-checkbox to config panel (ignore = don't load linked config,
  load instead host config from regular config file or from user-forced
  file in Host-panel)
- fullscreen mode always used no-taskbarbutton-mode. fixed.
- automatically default to ASPI if uaescsi.device is enabled and
  OS is Windows9x or if user has no admin privileges
- don't crash if DirectInput fails to initialize (Why does
  DirectInput8Create() fail with "unspecified error" when running
  WinUAE under different user using Windows XP "Run as..."-feature?)
- use SetPriorityClass() under 2000/XP instead of SetThreadPriority()
  (now Task Manager shows same priority settings as WinUAE GUI)

Beta 9:

- replaced "mixed stereo" with stereo separation adjustment and made
  mixed stereo delay buffer size adjustable, original mixed stereo
  buffer size was 5. (don't ask about mixed stereo delay buffer, I
  have no idea whats the point :) (Idea from xtc)
- quickstart-mode reset button fix
- CDTV Extended 2.7 is back, 2.3 renamed to 2.30
- A4000T KS 3.1 removed (apparantly it is not compatible with UAE)
- improved Kickstart CPU compatibility check
- added misc-checkbox for hiding Windows Taskbar-button
  (that was much easier said than done..)
- windowed mode DFx,Power,etc.. "leds" now support non-96DPI modes
- added more hardfile/harddisk error logging (non-blocksize aligned
  or out of bounds accesses)
- added mostly useless 1.8M BogoRAM selection (there were A500 2M
  expansions but 0.2M was lost "under" custom chip address space)
- included translation DLL for testing (but note that this won't be
  the final version)

Beta 8:

- added missing A500+ and A600 ROM scan messages
- model info, ROM scan messages are now translatable
- removed yellow "!" from message-dialogs
- possible fix for ancient "black bar at right border when
  centering is enabled and screen width is large enough"-bug
- remove floppies from disabled drives in quickstart-mode
- quickstart disk history was duplicated when selecting new image
  and image change caused configuration update.
- "config_hardware_path" and "config_host_path" config entries added
  They can be used to link two config files. I am not yet sure how to
  add GUI support for saving linked config files..
- replaced RDB filesystem relocator's 68020+ only instructions with
  68000-compatible instructions (oops..)
- added model info to Kickstart ROM information
- removed hack/beta KS 3.1 40.70 (0x917100a0, hack/beta) and CDTV
  Extended 2.7 (not confirmed), added A4000T KS 3.1 40.70 (0x75932c3a)
  (Kickstart info by Rodney Hester)

Beta 7:

- fixed beta 6 quickstart problems
- added A500Plus and A600-entries (A500P with KS 37.175 and A600 with
  37.350/37.300) and CDTV (with warning)
  Yes, I changed my mind again :)
- added very expanded example configuration to quickstart-page

Beta 6:

- better 68000 exception 3 (address error) return address
  calculation (fixes yet another copy protection)
- cycle-exact mode timing fixes (broke in 0826b1.. caused some
  (many?) copylock-protected images to fail, also Dynamic Hires images
  look much better now but it is not yet perfect.
- removed some unneeded code from ce-mode cpu
- removed compiler.c and compiler.h. No idea when this was last
  used (or maybe it was never really used?)
- added volume level value to sound panel
- keyboard led select boxes worked strangely, fixed
- more 68000 DIVU/DIVS undefined flags defined :)
- added more RDB parsing messages to log
- Overkill AGA graphics fix. WARNING: may cause graphics
  problem (shifted image) in other AGA games/demos.
  Keep your eyes open!
- don't check quickstart disk image bootable-status anymore after
  emulator has been started
- new (not yet released) caps library required
- force ROM rescan if WinUAE version info in registry is older
  than current version
- bootblock crc check added to quickstart insert-disk check
- german keyboard #-key hack fix (Bernd Roesch)
- disable chipset speed settings if 68000 and cycle-exact enabled
- quickstart and paths icons added (Jani Wilen)
- wider harddrive-dialogs
- added "enable RDB-mode"-button to hardfile dialog
  (it only clears sectors, surfaces and reserved-fields)
- dialog should really appear correctly in fullscreen mode
- added CRC32-tooltip to quickstart DF0-select box arrow.
  (why? bug reports without enough info to confirm used image..)


Beta 5:

- dragndrop didn't close filehandles (left files that were not
  possible to delete or rename until WinUAE was exited)
- save state key shortcuts fixed (broke in beta 2, I think)
- added tooltip support to every control in GUI (this is quite
  stupid: All dialog strings with "[]" in them is split to two pieces.
  Dialog string is replaced with leftmost piece and tooltip is added
  with rightmost piece. Stupid but this does not need any extra resources,
  is automatic and it is easy for translators)
- example tooltips added to keyboard A, B and C-checkboxes
- more tooltips to cpu, disk and chipset tab. Help needed, I am not going
  to write any more myself..
- configuration tooltip fixed
- replaced tooltips with balloon tooltips
- disk history weirdness fixed (randomly changing disks etc..)
- added message if "Add harddrive" does not detect any drives
- updated NT-based Windows' admin privilege-check
- removed ECS Denise-selection. OCS Agnus + ECS Denise was never used
  (probably does not even work on real Amigas)
- update last used config file name when saving config
- more common notifications/error messages can be translated
- added message that appears only once when saving to standard adf and
  saved track is not standard AmigaDOS format.

Beta 4:

- return back to GUI if Kickstart ROM is missing and Kickstart
  replacement fails (do we even need this anymore?)
- don't add nonexisting files to disk history
- added saveimage delete-button to disk-panel (only visible when there
  is saveimage present for selected image)
- added -diskswapper=image1.adf,image2.adf,...-command line parameter
- startup-zlib-dialog-crash fixed
- improved rom scanner, now Kickstart ROMs/keyfile are detected even
  if all roms are stored in single zip...
- stupid disk writing bug fixed, causes some crappy disk routines to
  save corrupted data, for example SWOS. (was introduced in 0.8.26)
- paraport direct parallel port support improved
  (busy signal was inverted, printing works now)
- mapped AmigaDOS H-flag to Windows hidden-flag. This leaves S-flag
  but there are no Windows flags left..
- moved "no uaefsdb"-checkbox to harddisk-panel
- added scaling support to all software filters
- testing tooltips in model selection area (texts by G. Chillemi and me)
  Good or bad idea?
- added OCS A500 0.5M+0.5M configuration on top of list. Apparantly
  OCS A500 is the most common Amiga 500 (except here in Finland or
  something)
  
Beta 3:

- hardware/host-settings should now really work..
- filter presets added
- "clear registry" really removes all new keys now
- changed default joystick to keyboard layout B
- set default sound filter to emulated
- filter presets (saves filter settings plus lores, doubling,
  correct aspect and centering settings from display page)
- added avioutput path to paths-page

Beta 2:

- added missing Cloanto KS 1.3 and 3.1 CRCs
- Reset-button was enabled when inserting disk even if
  emulator was not yet started
- less ROM-check messages
- disable serial options if no serial port selected
- removed A500+/A600-configs (not much use here)
- removed CDTV config (not much point until CDROM works)
- don't load quickstart-page's config when entering quickstart
  page for the first time if quickstart-mode is not enabled
- don't disable Start-button
- clear disk image paths when in quickstart mode (=don't load
  floppies from default.uae)
- added second drive, only enabled when RAM size is 1MB or
  larger.
- quickstart reset handling improved
- obsolete rom.key-GUI option removed
- hardware/host configurations save/load/delete fixed
- added simple JIT on/off switch (only sets cache to zero
  or max and it does not remember old value)

Beta 1:

I have been thinking of bumping version number to 1.0 in next
release. Emulation seems to be good enough, GUI looks ok
and now finally there is long-awaited "quickstart"-mode for
"normal" emulator users.

I really request comments about Quickstart-mode GUI. One or
two drives? Build-in configs are ok? ROM-messages are ok?

It is possible I have gone really too far this time..

- more support for small devices, debugger can be disabled
  by editing sysconfig.h
- dialogs don't appear behind the screen in fullscreen modes
- warn only once when saving state with harddisk(s) enabled
- chip ID-register (VPOSR upper byte) never reported ECS Agnus
  (broke in 0.8.26)
- TST.x Ax, TST.x (d16,PC), TST.x (d8,PC,Xn), CMP.x #x,(d16,PC)
  and CMP.x #x,(d8,PC,Xn) are 68020+ only. There are probably
  more to fix.. (some 68000/68010-instructions don't support
  all addressing modes)
- SMBFS, FAT95, AmigaNCP map Windows System-flag to AmigaDOS Pure-flag,
  so do it also in UAE filesystem emulation, also archive bit was
  inverted
- configuration file scanner didn't work correctly if directory
  was deeper than 1 level, fixed, also added limit to 3 levels
- added CRC32 ROM-detection (only common official ROMs supported)
- show selected ROM's name instead of filename in ROM-page if
  selected ROM is in CRC32-list
- all detected ROMs are added to ROM-filename selectbox
- statefile ROM CRC32 is used to select correct ROM when loading state
- ROM path is scanned when starting WinUAE for the first time,
  ROM path is changed or Rescan ROMs-button is clicked
- added Paths-page
- added QuickStart-page (for users that only want to run floppy based
  programs without need to know anything about configuration)
- rom.key-path is basically obsolete now, WinUAE automatically tries
  all possible locations for rom.key. (current dir, rom-path etc..)
  Any reasons for not removing the rom.key-path from GUI?
- switching from A1000/CD32/CDTV mode to normal-mode and back works
  now correctly
- changed default configuration to regular Amiga 500-config, also
  some other default config tweaks
- in quickstart-page inserted disk image's bootblock is checked
  - no bootblock/wrong checksum = don't accept image
  - OFS bootblock -> continue
  - FFS/FFS+INT bootblock -> autoselect KS2.04 config (if previous
    config was < KS 2.04)
  - FFS+DIRCACHE bootblock -> autoselect KS3.0 config (if previous
    config was < KS 3.0)
- "Clear registry"-button in paths-page can be used to remove
  all new WinUAE registry entries, for easier beta testing
- added hardware/host-specific configurations, autoload checkbox =
  automatically load selected hardware/host-only config after "regular"
  config

TODO:

- new icons

btw, is there are any problems using names like "Amiga" or "Kickstart"?

0.8.27

Beta 4: (final?)

- AVIOutput tweaks (enable-button is disabled until codec(s)
  are selected, don't clear selected codec(s) after recording
  is stopped, no more clicks in recorded sound while alt-tabbing
  and more)
- COPJMP-delay was 2 cycles too short, fixes 2000AD-intro
  (properly this time!) and Total Triple Trouble-intro's missing
  characters (sprites)
- debugger: added illegal access logger (any memory access to
  non-existing memory or "non-official" custom chip/cia address is
  logged) enable with "wd"-command, delete addresses with "wd x y"
  where x = start address y = length of range.
- A1000 boot rom works again (b1)
- some centering tweaks

Beta 3:

- don't exit if using 68020+ Kickstart ROM without 68020 CPU
- fixed rare null filter crash
- full collision setting fixed. Game called "Rotor" does
  require working CLXDAT collision bit 0 (="full collision")
  This is the first known program that needs full collision!
- 68000 CLR.L/NEG.L/NEGL.X/NOT.L data access order finally fixed
  (read first word, read second word, write second word, write
  first word) This is important because there are some demos
  that do CLR.L $DFF088..
- contents of zipped files in disk history-list had extra space
  in the beginning of filename. fixed. (b1)

Beta 2:

- added correct return value in 68000+more compatible/ce-mode when
  accessing CIA-address space without selecting any CIA (both
  CIA selection address bits 12 and 13 set) rtclock, buggy
  A1000 "Insider"-memory expansion's real-time clock setting
  utility program works now without crashing.
- state saves were saved in random point instead of at the
  beginning of vblank. (broke somewhere during 0.8.22 or so)
- debugger 'am'-command fixed
- removed disk swapper auto disk insert when loading config.
  It wasn't too good idea. (disk in swapper position 1, eject disk,
  save config and load config -> disk is back in df0..)
- vertical/horizontal centering fixed! (or at least it is much
  improved) Does not fix bar in right side of screen if using too
  large resolution
- MIDI does not require selected serial port anymore
- "exter_int_helper: unknown native action" is confirmed fixed
  (bug has been there since native2amiga.c was originally created..)
- re-added SPCFLAG_DOINT, JIT seems to have too weird timing to
  work without it in some cases.. Non-JIT modes still use new and
  more compatible method.
- fixed crash in CDTV-mode (broke in 0826B1)
- D3D and OpenGL mode fullscreen ALT-TAB fixed
- harddisk "bad blocksize" error (broke in b1)
- typing to disk image text boxes was ignored, fixed
- bug in kickstart loader fixed (b1, 256K ROMs only)

Beta 1:

- loading empty config/directory crashes (broke in beta 4)
- ports-page's joystick/mouse radiobuttons were not initialized
- added some source configuration options for low memory devices
- config file scanner ignored extension of files and scanned
  ALL files in configurations-directory, even binary files..
- GUI works with non-96 DPI font settings (arg, only bug was
  different font in "panel"-dialog than "page"-dialogs..) 
- removed "Highest" priority setting. It was mostly useless and
  slightly dangerous too.
- added check for too small hardfiles (zero or smaller than block
  size), also block size set to zero is not anymore allowed.
  (no more "tried to seek out of bounds! (FFFFFFFFFFFFC000 >= 0)"
  error message)
- JIT got confused and crashed if CPU setting was modified or
  JIT-enabled state file was loaded
- OpenGL fullscreen mode now uses DirectDraw to change screen's
  resolution instead of ChangeDisplayMode(). ALT-TAB works now
  properly.
- added missing semaphore-protection to native2amiga.c
  (fixes random "exter_int_helper: unknown native action xxx"
  errors and freezes when using for example uaescsi.device
  and hardfile(s) at the same time) NOT CONFIRMED YET
- interrupt delay in JIT mode reintroduced with much smaller
  and safe delay. (AB 3D II works again)
- new rtg.library, 20-30 times faster pixel read function in
  32-bit Picasso96 modes. Used in alphablending. (Bernd Roesch)
- fixed forever repeating "...because desktop is too small for
  the specified window size.."
- only add images inside zip to history if there are more than
  one image
- saving config: add ".uae"-extension to config file name if
  missing
- buffer overflow in drive click code fixed

0826

Beta 6:

- enter disk swapper for the first time, press up, first image
  disappears, fixed.
- ancient MIDI-IN freeze bug finally fixed
- module ripper's dialog boxes appeared "behind" WinUAE's screen
  in fullscreen modes
- disk image history list: move selected item to top of list
- move ripper to output-page (path etc.. improvements won't be
  implemented until 0.8.26 has been released)
- entering and exiting gui didn't restore 8-bit Picasso96-palette
  if opening GUI didn't force drop to desktop
- use GUI's real size (Windows XP styles can make it bigger than
  default) instead of hardcoded 640x480 when determining if GUI
  fits to current fullscreen mode
- more FDI2 updates
- added workaround to "turbo speed"-problem in non-ce modes
  (for example Battle Squadron cracktro by Freestyle)
- END+Fx-disk change shortcuts didn't add image to history list,
  fixed
- disabled interrupt delays in JIT-mode. That was not too good
  idea.. (crashed some programs)
- configuration "save as"-button used wrong path, fixed

Beta 5:

- "... Switching to full-screen display."-messages didn't work
  and crashed the emulator.. (oops)
- don't show paths in disk swapper-page
- disk swapper crash fixed (stupid bug, missing "break;" oops*2)
- loading config file copies inserted disk images in disk drives
  to disk swapper and also fills empty drives from disk swapper
  automatically.
- reload configuration file list after loading new config and
  emulation has already been started
- don't restart immediately if loading new config and show gui
  is not ticked and emulation has already been started
- fixed debugger memwatch point command's parsing of 'rw'
- cycle exact blitter/cpu-timing was broken since beta 1..
  (Robotics Life and others again..) I tried to store 0x100 to
  8-bit buffer.. (and oops^2)
- Pro Wizard module ripper included! (http://asle.free.fr/prowiz/)
  Supports over 50 packed tracker formats, automatically converts
  them back to standard Protracker format.
- enabling warp-mode (END+PAUSE) does not freeze the emulator in
  JIT-modes anymore
- moved multirevolution (= copy protections that use weak bits)
  code from common disk emulation to disk image-specific code
- improved FDI2 decoding (Vincent Joguin)

Beta 4:

- made debugger t and z -commands log all exceptions
- state save/restore added to input-tab
- dropped configuration file separation. maybe in next release,
  will need much more design time..
- FPU emulation bug fix. Fxxx.B #yy,FPz-style commands used wrong
  address (high byte instead of low byte) to fetch immediate value.
  It seems this has always been broken..
- configuration load/save page now remembers last selected config
  file
- m68k shift instructions timing improved in cycle-exact mode

Beta 3:

  NOTE: ignore the "Type"-select box in configuration page. It will
  change in next beta. Comments are not accepted :)

- caps bitcell timed track + saveimage crash fixed
- made GUI slightly smaller and improved child-dialog positioning
- updates systray icon if explorer restarts
- dropping config file to gui or window restarts emulation immediately
  if "Show GUI on startup"-checkbox in new config file is unchecked
- undocumented filesys_no_uaefsdb-config option added to GUI
  (prevents creation of new UAEFSDB-files which means all comments,
  protection flags not supported by host filesystem are lost, also it
  prevents creation of file names with "illegal" characters inside
  of emulation)
- "Knin Peaks" disk emulation fix broke software that set DSKLEN = 0
  (usually used by some copy protections) Fixed.
- store windowed GUI position in registry. GUI in fullscreen is
  always centered.
- JSR-instruction's prefetch fixed (protection code in original
  Datastorm)
- Windows XP styles supported
- 68000 exception processing stack pushes are now executed in
  exactly the same order as real 68000 does them (ce-mode only)
- D-channel only blit with ALWM or AFWM != 0xffff fixed
  (ce-mode only, Elfmania loading screen)
- caches configuration file list, reload only when saving
  or deleting.
- refresh rates in parenthesis don't anymore get reset to default
  (parenthesis = display driver does not support selected rate
  but it still may be available if some tweaking program is in use)
- added supported refresh rates to winuaebootlog.txt
- debugger breakpoints and memwatch points work now even if address
  register's high 8 bits contain crap and UAE is emulating 24-bit
  address space (copy protections..)
- implemented more correct interrupt delays and removed now obsolete
  SPCFLAG_DOINT, also (temporarily?) added experimental 68020+
  interrupt "fix" which may not be safe..
- POTGO fix (even "simple" io-port handling is complex in Amiga..)
  fixes for example The Band's Human Killing Machine trainer
- audio emulation tweaks. noise in Warhead and Hammerfist, 100 most
  remembered C64 tunes freeze and most importantly, without breaking
  Mission Elevator :)
- compressed state file Action Replay bug fix (but AR statefile
  support isn't too stable)
- added missing address error exception check in exception handler
  (and another copy protection works..)

Beta 2:

- full drag'n'drop support, config files/disk images/state files/roms
  supported.
- entering gui from smaller than 640x480 fullscreen mode fixed

Beta 1:

- GUI update! I am expecting lots of suggestions..
- Configuration Load/Save-page updated, directory support addded
- replaced floppy text box with select box, works as a combined disk
  image text box and history list (30 last used images, also
  automatically lists images inside zips) History list is stored in
  registry.
- added Disks-page for quick disk swapping (work in progress)
- systray icon and menu
- new icons (Jani Wilen)

- scsi logging improved and moved to non-host specific code
- AmiTradeCenter (ftp-client) bsdsocket emulation compatibility fix (SR)
- gethostname() CTRL-C-signal fix (SR)
- added debugger audio channel enable/disable command
  (am <channel mask>)
- Final (...) sprite-bitplane collision fix (Aunt Arctic Adventure)
- IRQ level 7 didn't wake CPU up from possible STOP-state
- END+PAUSE warp-mode sets frameskip temporarily to 10 (2-8x speedup)
  except in cycle-exact mode (ce-mode's timing needs zero frameskip)
- added Quit emulator -option to input source list
- MODE SENSE/SELECT 6<>10 translation bug fix, 4 last data bytes were
  replaced with random data (usually zeros) Was not noticed because
  most programs use larger buffer than required.
- cause bus error exception (and logs current CPU state) if program
  jumps to non-existing memory and CPU is 68020+. ("Your Amiga program
  just did something terribly stupid")
- added exception handler that tries to trap instruction opcode
  accesses. You see small dialog box explaining the situation. it
  will be removed in release version. This usually happens when memory
  gets corrupted and program flow "falls" off the end of memory bank.
  These two fixes should prevent most 68020 and/or JIT WinUAE crashes
  without any perfomance loss.
- CE-mode 68000 instruction tweaks here and there
  (I found out that you can use special blitter mode to "log" data bus..
  More fixes later)
- JIT is confirmed compatible with Windows XP SP2's data execution
  prevention (missed three smaller buffers in previous DEP fix)
- crash automatically creates minidump file to WinUAE's directory
  (winuae_yyyymmdd_hhmmss.dmp) Minidumps helps debugging the crash.
  Zip and send the file if I request it.
- RTS/RTD/RTE return address exception 3 fix
- Picasso96 WaitForVSync fixed, demo "Fake Electronic Lightshow" by
  Ephidrena is now usable in RTG-mode.
  Windowed mode = Virtual vsync. Uses frame rate from gui, default = 60
  Fullscreen = Virtual vsync. Uses fullscreen mode's refresh rate.
  Fullscreen + Vsync = real vsync.
  btw, before someone asks after checking the sources: update is
  "hidden" in filesys.asm..
- zipped statefiles and zipped dms files work again
- ancient 8-bit Picasso96-mode palette problem solved
- don't crash if emulated harddisk is removed while emulation is
  running
- disk emulation fix (Knin Peaks by Reality)
- cycle-exact single channel blit speed fix (very undocumented
  feature..)
  fixes slowdown in demos Revival and How 2 Skin a Cat.

0.8.25:

- even more improved AVIOutput. Added enable/disable button, entering GUI
  does not stop the recording anymore. Picasso96 modes supported.
  (config file support will be added in future version)
- cycle exact blitter B-channel handling fix (Arte)
- drivesound: don't play "snatch"-sound if drive is empty
- "2000AD"-fix removed, it isn't really right either, later...

Beta 3: (final?)

- added uaescsi.device logging, enable it with -scsilog command line parameter
- Windows XP multimouse really works now
- added uaescsi.device ATAPI INQUIRY and MODE SENSE/SELECT 6<>10 translation code,
  fixes IDE CDROM compatibility problems with PlayCD and probably others too.
  (thanks to Oliver Kastl) TEST THIS!
- added frame limit -checkbox to avioutput page. checked = disable frame limit
  and don't output sound, unchecked = frame limit enabled and sound output enabled.
  (maybe somebody wants to record and play the game at the same time..)

Beta 2:

- drive sound sample rate conversion code was total crap..
- calcdiw() vpos >= minfirstline-check re-commented, correct place is in decide_line()
  (corrupted some regular Workbench native screen modes)
- display/resolution enumeration code updates
- desktop size check corrected
- increased supported input devices from 4 to 6
- some small directinput cleanups
- bsdsocket emulation update. CNet's SMTPd works now. (Stephan Riedelbeck)
- don't use bitcell timing buffer when writing to disk..
- avioutput is now much faster (on some display cards it was already fast but
  on others it was very slow, about max 5fps..)
  Display data is fetched directly from UAE's internal buffer instead of using
  slow reading from display RAM if any display filter is enabled (except D3D or OGL)
  Also display size and depth config options were removed, now you get exactly
  the same display as you see. (I didn't want to add complex display depth
  conversion code when you can easily do the same by changing WinUAE's display
  settings..)

Beta 1:

- "Windows mouse" doubleclicking fixed
- drive sound volume was not saved to config file
- right border is not clipped anymore even if program uses max overscan. Finally..
  (Settlers, Pinball Illusions etc..) NOTE: screen position has changed a little.
- filter display buffer width increased to 736, old 708 was too small for max overscan.
  (noted here because it can also affect screen position slightly in filter-modes)
- fixed display corruption in programs that update DDFSTRT just when display
  starts. Fixes Mystic Tunes by Vertical, Bierkrug-tro by TEK, Forgotten Realms
  Slideshow '90 by Fraxion and probably much more..)
- "more compatible" now enables very basic prefetch emulation in non-JIT
  68010-68040 CPU models. (very rarely needed, I currently know only 2 programs)
- multimonitor code didn't ignore disabled displays, caused DX errors when
  WinUAE started.
- input code didn't check max number of detected devices, having more than 4
  mice, joysticks or keyboards in input tab crashed WinUAE.
- don't start bitplane dma until vpos >= minfirstline (comparison was commented
  out for some reason) Fixes old demo Back in bizness by 2000AD
- RTG-RAM start address was not saved to statefile, restoring it caused RTG
  RAM being mapped over chip RAM.. (not really problem because full Picasso96
  state is not supported yet)


0.8.24

Beta 3:

- drive sound was mixing (empty) sounds even if all drive sounds were disabled
- added "Windows mouse" to input-tab. It has exactly the same "feeling" as WinUAE's
  mouse before directinput-input code was implemented.
- fixed stupid debugger bug, remove breakpoint-command didn't check if breakpoint was already removed..
- "saveimages" were limited to "parent"-image's max number of tracks (for example writing
  to track 80 was ignored if parent image was standard 80 track (0-79) adf)
- lores-checkbox is back, it wasn't as useless as I originally thought..
- debugger 't'-command can now be used to step more than 1 instruction (t <number>)
- cycle-exact BLITPRI timing fix (Robotics Life, probably others too..)
- improved 68k MUL and DIV -instruction timing in ce-mode
- improved FDI 2.0 support

Beta 2:

- more debugger updates, search-command s <"string">/<hexvalues> [<addr]> [<length>]
  bl lists all stored "state recorder" states
- F12 now works even if all keyboard(s) are disabled in input-tab..
- added volume-slider to sound-tab, added volume up/down/mute shortcuts
  (end+numpad minus, end+numpad plus and mute = end+numpad star, also mapped to "multimedia" keys)
- hide single raw mouse, having two identical mice is too confusing I think.
- moved some hardcoded GUI-strings to resource
- power/led/etc led initialization fixed (editing the GUI before starting the emulation didn't
  update all necessary variables, editing on the fly worked fine)
- display frequency-setting affects now Picasso96-modes (no more default refresh rate)
- drive sound emulation :) (James Bagg, me)
  You can also use external samples if you put files called drive_click_xxx.wav,
  drive_spin_xxx.wav, drive_startup_xxx.wav and drive_snatch_xxx.wav (xxx = whatever you want,
  "click" is the only mandatory sample) to directory called <winuae path>\uae_data\ (better suggestions?)
- fullscreen multimonitor support
- better multimonitor compatibility (use correct display limits instead of primary display
  limits when positioning WinUAE's main window, non-primary screen overlay mode works etc..)
- "state recorder" is now mostly working. It takes automatic state saves every x seconds to its internal
  buffer (size is also configurable). "Rewind"-key can be configured in input-tab or also END+numpad /
  can be used. (This feature may not be in next official release)

Beta 1:

- don't ignore frame skip setting when capturing AVI
- implemented "memory state recorder" (don't ask about it yet..)
- bsdsocket updates from Stephan Riedelbeck
  fixes TCP device TCP:<port>, Apache and maybe other programs too.
- Windows XP multi-mouse support and DirectInput mouse-handling updates
  Windows XP-only: Input-tab now lists regular DirectInput-mouse and
  one or more "raw" mouse.
  Windows 9x/ME: only USB-mice can be handled separately, PS/2 mouse is always
  only connected to "supermouse" (DirectInput system default mouse that combines all
  separate mouse events, marked with '*' in input-tab)
  -> two USB mice are required for two mouse games under 9x/ME
  and finally, Windows 2000 does not have any support for multiple mice,
  all you get is single "supermouse".
  Big note: currently you need to disable default-mouse first if you want any
  events from non-default mouse.
- fixed JIT default settings without loading any configuration
  (log was filling with JIT error messages..)
- cleaned up Kickstart ROM loader part of memory.c
- saving compressed state file without zlib1.dll didn't correctly fall back to non-compressed mode
  (created corrupted statefiles with completely empty memory chunks..)
- crash after 4th or 5th state save finally fixed (very embarrassing mistake..)
- fixed crash when Picasso96 was enabled and graphics filter GUI was accessed
- FDI 2.0 support (not complete yet)
- lots of debugger improvements (much more useful now..)
 - f-command extended:
    f without parameters = break when PC not in ROM and current instruction is not
    0x4ef9 (don't break when executing library jump tables) Great for finding start
    address of bootblock.
    f i = break when PC points to RTS/RTR/RTE-instruction
    f i <opcode> = break when PC points to instruction opcode <opcode>
    f <addr> = add/remove new breakpoint (max 8)
    fd = remove all breakpoints
    f <addr1> <addr2> = break when <addr1> <= PC <= <addr2>
 - W-command's value-parameter can be decimal 12345 or hexadecimal (0x12345 or $12345)
    write size is byte if val < 256, word if 255 > val < 65536 and long if val > 65535.
    (previous version's write size was always long and was limited to chip ram)
 - memwatch break points added, w <0-3> <address> <length> <r/w/rw> [<value>]
    break when address space between address and address + length is accessed and
    if accessed value = <value> R = break only on reads, W = writes, RW = both
 - i-command: interrups and traps combined, VBR supported
 - custom register dump -command added (e), dumps the contents of all existing registers
   between 0xdff000-0xdf1ff.
 - CIA dump-output slightly modified, added TOD stopped status-flag
 - exiting debugger automatically creates "memory state" and b-command can be used
   to "rewind" (again, don't ask and don't try yet..)

0823

- small AUDxDAT fix (The Pawn's music was broken again..)

Beta 4:

- sprite emulation fix, broke in b1 (Hybris bullets/score)
- JIT cache is now allocated with PAGE_EXECUTE-flag (=JIT compiled code is allowed to run)
  Future Windows versions may not enable PAGE_EXECUTE by default due to security reasons.
- merged first source patch from Richard Drummond (http://www.rcdrummond.net/uae/)
- "figure_pixel_formats" possible infinite loop fixed
- zip/gzip support requires now new zlib1.dll instead of old zlib.dll
- forced blitter finish when saving state didn't work correctly in ce-mode (yeah, again..)
  (could cause infinite loop and freeze when saving)

Beta 3:

- non-ce blitter speed was wrong (broke in b1)
- MAPROM-emulation checkbox fixed and moved to ROM-tab
- problems with keyboard leds and priorities fixed
- slightly changed filter GUI (support for future 3x/4x filters)
- increased the range of filter size/position adjustments
- fixed bug that causes randomly lost characters received from serial port
- delay simultaneous disk inserts
- more commands (pause, turbo, irq7 etc..) added to input-tab
- scale is halved when in D3D/OGL-mode and resolution is smaller than 450*350
- clock sync option removed from GUI (causes too many problems)
- screenshot system freeze fixed (Windows9x/ME only)

Beta 2:

- don't complain about AGA requiring 16 bit if selected screen mode is 8-bit Picasso96-mode
- blitter emulation updates for very buggy programs that starts blitter before updating
  BLTCON0 and BLTCON1.. (old Psygnosis games) Was partially broken in R9. This fix was already
  included in B1 but I forgot to add changelog entry.
- fixed bug in blitter update that broke textured line mode
- uaescsi.device unit numbers always start from 0 (0 = first CDROM, 1 = possible second
  and finally other SCSI devices if available) Unit 0 is reserved for CDROM, first available
  unit number will be 1 if PC has no CDROM(s) but other supported SCSI devices.
  This makes CD filesystem installation more user friendlier.
- AHI emulation improvements (Bernd Roesch)
- state saving happens immediately after selecting state file name (woohoo..)
- complain if HD emulation is enabled when saving state
- added some unused keycodes to input-tab
- forced blitter finish when saving state didn't work correctly in ce-mode
  resulting in slightly corrupted state files.
- fixed very stupid mistake in CIA parallel port read routine, fixes parallel port
  joystick adapter, was broken in r8b4.
- Picasso96 faster solid window moving (Bernd Roesch)
- bcc.b was 2 cycles too fast in ce-mode (probably does not fix anything..)
- SPTI-CDROM didn't use shared mode, fixes media change detection problems
- added MAPROM-like feature (jumper on Blizzard's accelerator cards that map Kickstart
  ROM space to RAM) Enable-checkbox in misc-tab, uaelib function 80 returns mapped memory area.
  (0 = no support, 0xffffffff = not enabled, other = mapped RAM address, currently hardcoded
  to 0xe00000) Thanks to BlizKick's author for adding support

Beta 1:

- cpu usage meter implemented, results may be surprising...
  (note that in "fastest possible" it always shows 100%+ except when
  idle-mode is enabled and cpu is executing STOP-instruction)
- more undocumented features found, switching bitplane DMA on during DDF can have
  (at least) 3 different results:
  1: OCS only: nothing happens, bitplane fetches don't restart until next line
  (only this condition was emulated in older versions)
  2: ECS/AGA: fetches start normally if DMA was disabled outside of DDF or during
  current line (Sixth Sense Investigation's buggy copper list requires this..)
  3: ECS/AGA: display processing goes to "DDFSTOP passed"-condition immediately
  if DMA was disabled inside of DDF during any previous line
- add missing ".avi" automatically to avioutput filename
- overlay state was not reset when changing display modes, caused
  "The selected screen mode can't be <blahblah>"-message and forced
  unnecessary fullscreen mode.
- Page Up-key is available for user configuration if Action Replay is not enabled
- AWeb/IBrowse bsdsocket.library possible connection freeze/slowdown fix
  (Stephan Riedelbeck)
- switching from 68000 to 68020+ JIT-mode works and also fixed crash if switching
  from 68000+CE-mode to JIT-mode
- added hack that syncs CIA-TOD to host system's time. No need to run restoretime
  hack anymore. Checkbox in misc-tab. (hack = may cause compatibility problems)
- misc-tab split. Priority options moved to "Priority"-tab, added separate priority
  setting for active, inactive and minimized WinUAE.
- don't zero LOF-bit when executing customreset(), fixes original Shinobi
- bsdsocket SBTC_SIGIOMASK support, fixes Jabberwocky. Thread priority updates.
  (Stephan Riedelbeck)
- enforcer-style debugging improved (Bernd Roesch, Sebastian Bauer)
- restoring state didn't update floppy drive type correctly, fixed
- sometimes Amiga left mouse button got stuck when WinUAE lost focus, fixed

R9:

Beta 4:

- fullscreen height was incorrectly initialized when loading "old" config files
- avioutput width and height are correctly initialized
- null filter centering fixed (null is 1x, not 2x..)
- moving GUI over fullscreen software filter mode didn't refresh screen
- it is now possible to disable creation of UAEFSDB-files by adding
  unofficial config entry "filesys_no_fsdb=true" to config file
- automatic AVIOutput AVI split before file size goes over 2G
- GUI disappearing "behind" the screen in fullscreen mode fixed
- fixed "bug" (removed one consistency check..) in unzip code, some zip files
  didn't uncompress. Either unzip code I use is buggy or zip file is slightly
  broken (but winzip nor winrar didn't complain)
- AVIOutput sound and video sync problems fixed
- don't stop AVIOuput recording when entering END+Fx-disk change dialog
- "AGA 16-bit"-message box was incorrectly shown in windowed mode
- "saveimage"-floppy write support was again broken.. (it was possible to make
  zipped files write-enabled but writing to "saveimage" was still ignored..)

Beta 3:

- software filters fixed in windowed non-overlay mode
  Only Scale2X and Null support 32-bit, filter defaults to null if unsupported
  filter is selected. (wrong filter is better than black screen..)
- crash with sound disabled fixed
- another bsdsocket connection fix
- separated width and height for fullscreen and windowed modes
- hide lores-checkbox, lores is now automatically enabled if doubling is disabled
  (But maybe there was/is reason for separate horizontal and vertical doubling?)
- removed lots of compilation warnings
- replaced IOCTL_GET_GEOMETRY with more compatible IOCTL_CDROM_GET_GEOMETRY,
  properly fixes Windows 2000 CD32 CD detection.
- disable "Add Harddrive"-button if Windows is not NT-based

Beta 2:

- immediate blitter works again
- return 0xffffffff again when CPU >= 68020 and reading non-existing memory
- uncompressed RAM dump added to state save dialog
- loading config that mounts floppy drive don't anymore cause
  "no disk in drive A:"-dialog
- bsdsocket.library updates (Stephan Riedelbeck)
  - accept(socket, 0, 0) works, fixes IRCD
  - gethostbyname (Windows 9x only) could freeze for couple of seconds
  - reset socket error after gethostbyname, fixes AmyGate
  - connection failures on some systems
- scale2x, supereagle, 2xsai and super2xsai 2x filters integrated
  (all except scale2x borrowed from ScummVM project)
  filter configuration changed again, null filter added (=filter that
  does nothing but allows vertical and horizontal position adjustment)
  Currently only supports 16-bit modes (automatically forces 16-bit)
- added message and force 16-bit if 8-bit and AGA is enabled
- SPTI CDROM eject/insert media detection fix
- it seems IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY is only supported on Windows XP,
  added workaround that fixes CD32 emulation in non-ASPI mode on Windows 2000

Beta 1:

- fixed (I hope) compiler optimization bug, at least ROXL.W didn't set N-flag correctly
  maybe other rarely used instructions also had problems
  (broke CAPS Rick Dangerous 2 protection code)
- NTSC-mode vsync sound fixed
- don't crash in CD32 mode if both ASPI and SPTI are not available
- added CAPS-support (and CE-support) to mini-version due to popular request.
  I hope this does not cause any unnecessary slowdown. Executable is now
  2x bigger because of included "more compatible" and "ce"-cpu emulators.
- implemented 100% (I think..) exact blitter block-mode cycle diagram in ce-mode
  (minus possible bugs..) All tested "100+ bob" -routines work now without flashing.
  line mode cycle diagram is still not completely known.
- small ASPI CDROM media detection code change (may or may not help..)
- simplify audio emulation if 68020 or better selected. New code is "too" correct
  and causes timing problems if custom register/chip ram access is really too fast
  (fixes TBL's Tint-demo's music)
- sound calibration-button (may not be in final release)
- ticking/unticking 68000 "more compatible" checkbox on the fly now reconfigures the cpu
  emulator correctly, emulated program should not crash anymore.
- replaced "run at higher priority" with priority selection select box
- don't write obsolete config entries from old config file when saving
- D3D AVI capture works again (D3D AVI support code was mysteriously disappeared..)
- more audio changes again, old "Mission Elevator"-fix still wasn't correct enough
  (broke some music players) Audio state machine transitions from 1 to 5 seem to have
  unexplained delay(s). I think ME is the only game that requires this (and only because
  of stupid bug in ME's sound effect code..)
- SPTI CDROM media detection fixed (never noticed it because enabling debug-logging
  "fixed" the bug..)
- SPTI/ASPI CDROM possible crash fixed (both CD ROM fixes needed before I managed
  to install OS 3.9 without problems)

- R8

Beta 6:

- blitter always used exclusive fill mode, caused single pixel gap between
  filled polygons if program used inclusive mode (for example The Pink Circle by Arcane)
  I broke it accidentally some releases ago, I think...
- optimized Picasso96 blitter emulation (Bernd Roesch)
- always compress "quick" state files
- startup config file description scan crash fixed (needed more than 100 or so config files..)
- size of display resolution table was too small
- mapped "AppMenu"-key to right Amiga key

Beta 5:

- display width is now forced divisible by 8 when adjusting width on the fly
- miniwinuae and regular winuae display mode list is now sorted identically
- cpu speed calculation overflowed if cpu frequency was >~2.8GHz (latest P4 CPUs)
  caused huge slowdown
- JIT CPU nop's removed
- clear execbase when reseting if memory size (any memory) was adjusted
- don't mount non-existing virtual directories (prevents red screen reset loop)
- updated AHI support (Bernd Roesch)
- F6-state shortcut removed, replaced with END + <numeric keypad number> (restore)
  and CTRL or SHIFT + END + <numeric keypad number> (save)
  zero or period = currently selected statefile (includes period because my keyboard
  ignores simultaneous CTRL/SHIFT + END + 0..)
  1 - 9 = currently selected statefile + "_" + <number> added to end of file but
  before extension.
- force full screen update after loading state file
- disable beta 4's "Fighting Soccer fix" if CPU >= 68020. I think there are too
  many bad sound routines that fail with "too" fast CPU or custom chipset access speed.
- fixed (I hope..) rare filesys crash when rebooting (introduced in beta 2)

Beta 4:

- wav-output created slightly incorrect wave files and frequency was not updated correctly
- GUI CPU JIT-page update, enable JIT checkboxes only if "Force Settings"-checkbox is ticked
- AR2/3 ROM bank size fixed
- CD32 audio CD play/stop/pause commands changed slightly, may fix some ASPI problems
- Picasso96 windowed<>fullscreen switch and reseting while in Picasso96 mode fixed
  (broken in beta 2)
- audio emulation fix, AUDxLEN is copied to backup register when DMA is enabled but
  AUDxPT when first DMA fetch happens. (fixes "Fighting Soccer" referee speech)
- D3D/OpenGL automatic doubling if selected resolution is "too large"
- free old harddrives before loading new config
- CIA-A TOD rate was about 11% too fast (broke in R7B1)

Beta 3:

- joystick keyboard layout B and C 2nd firebutton mapping
  (Right and left shift) was wrong and caused crashes.
- CD32 media change detection works properly (again..)
- bsdsocket.library emulation works again (stupid merge error by me..)
- prevent badly crashing programs setting very crazy vblank frequencies
- pause CD32 cd audio when GUI is active
- decreased the rate of HD-led flickering because there are keyboards that
  are really slow in changing led state
- fixed 57600 to 56000 serial bitrate rounding

Beta 2:

- fixed extended ADF HD floppy support
- DirectX version check fixed, only D3D support requires DX9
- selected 3D-mode was not saved correctly to config file, fixed
- About-tab is back.. (broken in B1)
- call fixup_prefs_dimensions() after loading config
- POTGO/POTGOR emulation improved, more compatible CD32 pad emulation
- Picasso96 display mode id strings fixed (broken in B1)
- SCSI emulation was accidentally disabled in B1
- added Direct3D screenshot support
- removed Output-tab from mini-version
- compiler updated to Visual Studio Net 2003
- "intelligent" CD detection in CD32 mode
- lores, correct aspect and linedoubling can be changed on the fly
- added wav-sound output support to Output-tab (select "*.wav" from "Save As Type:"-select box)
- virtual directory harddisk mapped to read-only directory (for example network share)
  is forced read-only
- it is (finally?) possible to return back to GUI and/or load new configuration.
  "Load" and "Load from"-buttons are now always enabled, new "Exit"-button can be
  used to return back to GUI (with old configuration intact)
  WARNING: expect bugs and memory leaks..
- bsdsocket.library emulation updates (Stephan Riedelbeck)
- changed mini-version's default config to basic A500


Beta 1:

- source tree is now  more configurable. sysconfig.h contains defines that can be used
  to enable or disable emulation features like JIT, AGA, autoconfig, harddisks, drop
  all CPU features except 68000 etc..
  I hope this helps porting (Win)UAE to slower devices like some PDAs etc..
- win32_displaymode and PicassoResolution -structures merged
- DirectDraw fullscreen mode flags fix (Sane)
- added workaround for buggy sound drivers (ISA SB16, maybe others) that return zero as
  minimum and maximum allowed sample rate...
- fast copper was always disabled. oops..
- another "last_custom_value" tweak, fixes Sonic - Irrepressible intro in ECS-mode
- non-DMA audio mode properly emulated, fixes Mortville Manor's and Maupiti Island's speech
- ext2-adfs' write-protection check fixed
- Direct3D filtering and scaling implemented. Should be faster because D3D allows
  direct rendering to texture's memory space. Note, DX9 required due to stupid MS
  decision: opening child windows (F12-GUI etc..) while in D3D fullscreen mode is not
  supported by DX8 API (Window simply disappears "behind" the screen..)
  Unfortunately I get weird smearing effect when moving the GUI window (display driver bug?)
- display resolution and depth can be changed on the fly
- D3D/OpenGL mode image adjustments changed, size sliders at 0/0 = 1:1 display ratio
- joypad problems fixed, bug affected some pads that have "point-of-view hat"-style
  direction controller
- fixed rare filesystem crash when copying files to directory in virtual harddisk's root
- END+F6 = load from last selected state file, SHIFT+END+F6 = save to last selected state file
- game Barney and Freddy Mouse by Kingsoft needs CLXDAT bit 15 set ("not used" says HRM but
  always set on my A500 and A1200)
- exiting GUI with Cancel or ESC cancels state save/restore request
- Freespace demo JIT FPU bug fix (Bernd Roesch)
- FPU rounding bug fix (Bernd Roesch)
- fast copper state saved to config file (I don't see any other way to fix graphics bugs on
  some games that fast copper causes)
- CD32 joypad emulation works again (oops, has been broken quite a long time..),
  default CD32 keyboard joypad mapping fixed, default joypad config added


R7 (30.05.2003)

Beta 5:

- zipped ipf-image support (new CAPS plugin required). No official multidisk support yet.
  (unofficially you can add "/<name of file>" or "\<name of file>" to the end of path,
  for example "c:\caps\PinballFantasies.zip\PinballFantasies_CourseDisk1.ipf")
  new CAPS plugin only for beta testers included.
- "KickShifter" ROM checksum recalculation was wrong, fixes red screen with some Kickstart versions
- bsdsocket Windows 2000/XP AmTelnet SSH freeze fixed (Stephen Riedelbeck)
- new AHI driver, fix for wrong maxsamplesize, includes separate patch for DigiBooster Pro 
  slowdown (Bernd Roesch)

Beta 4:

- "SWIV-fix" wasn't working if lores-mode was ticked, fixed
- "sprites outside playfield"-fix is now working in lores mode, also fixes black bar that appeared
  when running programs that use hires or shres mode, BRDSPRT was enabled and mouse pointer was
  moved near right border
- fixed broken "ShapeShifter" Kickstart patch code, replaced with generic patcher
  (KS 3.0+ use separate code path for 68040+ which was not patched and KS 2.04 patch was just wrong)
- "fake RDB" filesystem updates, multiple non-RDB custom filesystems works now properly
- GUI filesystem selection crash bug fixed
- beta 3 keyboard input update wasn't complete (loading new config was using old incompatible code)
- selected sound sample rate wasn't updated correctly if sound driver didn't support selected rate
- rewritten and cleaned display refresh rate selection code
- more weird undocumented blitter line mode features emulated:
  - after first pixel, C-channel's address is copied to D-channel.
    (first pixel is written to address pointed by D-channel, all following pixels are written to
    C-channel's address) Fixes Frantic's Cardamom and Cardamon demos.
  - BLTAPT stays unchanged if A channel is disabled. I found this useless feature when running
    tests on my A1200, probably never really used..
- "collision detection does NOT change when you select either single- or dual-playfield mode"
  says HRM. BZZZT, WRONG! Sprite to playfield collision detection should be correct (?) now.
  Fixes Inferior and Sub Rally (I call it "Suck Rally" for obvious reasons..)
- sprite DMA start raster line in NTSC mode fixed. This was surprising, first visible line in
  PAL is 28, NTSC 27. But first possible PAL sprite DMA position is 25, NTSC start is line 20.
  I was expecting smaller difference. Tested on my PAL A1200 in NTSC-mode.

Beta 3:

- horiz centering bug fixed (could cause crashes)
- trace-mode fix. fixes CAPS Defenders of Earth trace-vector-decoder protection routine.
- POTGOR emulation fixed (Sound of Silents -music disk ugly right mouse button test code..
  here is snippet: cmp.w #$0100,$dff016; bne right_button_not_pushed; ...)
- sectors, surfaces and reserved are automatically zeroed if selected hardfile contains RDB
- multiple keyboards supported, config save crash/non-working keyboard fixed when MS SideWinder
  Virtual Keyboard driver is installed.
- MOVEC-instruction fix, register 3 is 68040 only, it is not supported by 68020 (ancient bug, fixes
  Aladdin AGA and Banshee AGA in 68020 mode. CPU detection code detected MMU due to bug..)
- SWIV scoreboard graphics bug fixed (was caused by very weird undocumented OCS/ECS-only hardware feature)
- input point-of-view hat controller support
- small audio hardware reset fix

Beta 2:

- 68020+ instruction bcc.l was broken in 68000/68010 mode when cycle-exact mode was implemented
  (is really useless version of bcc.b when run under 68000/68010), fixes Paradox cracked Nitro
- harddisk partition detection updates. It seems Windows sometimes lies about drive's partition table
  (drive really only contains RDB partitions but Windows still thinks there are some empty
  MBR partitions..)
- improved Action Replay state file support
- new misc-page layout, added "Run at higher priority"-checkbox to misc page (sets process priority to higher
  than normal when WinUAE is active, helps skips and jumps caused by background processes)
- sound frequency GUI updated, allowed frequency range is now from 8000 to 48000 (max 96000 if sound card supports it)
- some experimental and buggy copper code from beta 1 removed..
- audio filter emulation (formula from
  http://groups.google.com/groups?q=g:thl3970091855d&dq=&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&selm=5sntr1%243ki%241%40nef.ens.fr)
- button/key mapped to mouse direction wasn't working correctly, fixed
- another bsdsocket fix (Stephen Riedelbeck)

Beta 1

- audio emulation fixes (fixes Mission Elevator again, this time proper fix)
- removed obsolete code (I think so..) when bitplane count during the raster line was
  decreased (single line of crap between playing area and scoreboard on Mission Elevator)
- Rainbow Island works again (broke in beta 4)
- serial port settings can be changed on the fly
- changing printer on the fly works
- printer didn't work if also serial port was enabled
- added serial port "direct"-checkbox, forces 115200 bit rate, lowers latency,
  needed by some serial linked games (Lotus 2) when connecting two PCs running WinUAE
- partial Action Replay state file support
- bsd socketfix for Ping Traceroute UDP Ping (Stephan Riedelbeck) 
  If you can test diropus Magellan with FTP Lister so please test,if this work as before.
  Try to connect to de.aminet.net dir aminet/new with anon on
  If you get no error 22 report from diropus for 5 trys all work ok 
- replaced uae_int with level 2 interrupt (was level 6), fixes buggy HD installable
  demos/games that disable level 6 interrupt. Using level 2 is more compatible
  because A1200/A4000 IDE-controller and A590/A2091 use level 2 interrupt.
  Also fixed bug that added uae_int handler twice. Set priority of interrupt to 20 (A1200 IDE uses it)
  Fixes game Old Timer and demo Captured Dreams by The Black Lotus (and probably much more..)
- CIA OVL-bit is ignored in AGA Amigas
- proper emulation of POTxDAT counters, analog joystick support in input-tab
- blitter in linedraw mode is weird, D-channel can be disabled without any effect on drawn line, enabling
  C-channel is enough. (undocumented feature, fixes Great Fun #16 packdisk)
- added hack that fixes buggy demos that read accidentally from write-only or non-existing custom
  registers and expect sane return values. Fixes Captured Dreams, Industrial Fudge, Codetrash.
- changed sprite-attach handling, even sprite attach-bit must not be ignored because setting it
  does something interesting.. and thats another undocumented feature, fixes Elfmania scoreboard
- DDFSTOP >= 0xe4 effect DOES NOT happen on OCS chipset, only on ECS and AGA... (fixes Sargon History -megademo)
- copper WAIT-wakeup state may not need free cycle, fixes Full Contact but I am not sure if this is correct fix..
- palette wasn't updated properly when entering and exiting the gui in fullscreen 8-bit Picasso96 mode
- new application icon (Michael Battilana)


R6 (19.04.2003)

Beta 6 (final?)

- disabling fast ram (or any expansion ram) and reseting the Amiga doesn't crash anymore
- do not reset when selected CPU is 68000 + compatible or cycle-exact and when program counter
  goes to no man's land (fixes demo Purple by Warfalcons, uses very bad and tricky protection..)
- right CTRL can be used to reset Amiga (RCTRL + INSERT + HOME or RCTRL + Windows keys)
- 68020+ word moves from non-word aligned custom registers fixed (for example move.w $dff005,d0 uuargh..)
  (fixes 4k AGA intro, Fuck the Pc! by Anorganic/Promise!) 
- DDFSTOP >= 0xe4 effect also happens on OCS and ECS chipsets, don't know why I missed that..
  (fixes Wind It Up Megamix 93)
- added DirectX 8 test
- full DIWHIGH save/restore support added
- OCS Agnus ignores DDFSTRT/DDFSTOP bit 1, this fixes Eliminator/Double Dragon 2 properly
  without stupid hacks. (Yes, both games are OCS only, tested on OCS and ECS A500 and A1000)
- default chipset changed to ECS Agnus and selecting >0.5M chip ram automatically enables ECS Agnus
  more compatible and less (hopefully..) complaints about programs that suddenly fail under OCS chipset..

Beta 5

- fixed stupid ASPI bug (bug introduced in B4)
- fixed ce-mode blitter freeze in Picasso96 modes
- fixed crash in Picasso96 mode if OpenGL was enabled (I think so, it didn't crash here..)
- pause-mode (END+PAUSE) fixed (bug introduced in B4)
- simplified and improved disk wordsync and indexsync emulation (fixes Quadlite's "El Egg Tronic Quarts" -slideshow)
- CIA-A LED and OVL bit fix (wasn't proper enough last time..)
- input-tab disable-checkbox implemented, unticked = selected input device is disabled completely
- added Amiga joystick port swap button to input-tab and other input fixes
- AGA dualplayfield color fix, this confirms that BPLCON4 is used normally in DPF mode
  (fixes Tube Warriors bottom of screen, one wrong colored horizontal line still remains)
- 9-bit mode serial port hack implemented. PC hardware don't support 9-bit mode (1 start, 9 data and 1 stop bits)
  but this hack transparently doubles the baud rate and sends/receives two characters when using 9-bit mode.
  Only works if two PCs running WinUAE are connected, PC - Amiga connection naturally can't work.
  Serial linked games should now work (Stunt Car Racer and Lotus 2 tested and confirmed working)
- added support for weird AGA only -feature, if DDFSTOP is >= 0xe4 (= can't be never reached), display DMA
  always starts at 0x18 (DDFSTRT is ignored). This also confirms that position 0x18 is first possible bitplane
  DMA slot. (fixes CCCP-demo and Hellfire cractro graphics garbage)
- ECS/AGA SPRxCTL bits 5 and 6 emulated (vertical start and stop bit 9) (fixes The Dark Demon - Burning Spears demo)
- chipset type can be changed on the fly

Beta 4

- blitter slowdown code fix
- CD32 pad buttons work properly again
- CPU idle checkbox replaced with a slider (was already in B3 but forgot to include changelog entry)
  note that slider works now differently than in B3:
  Slider fully left = disabled, every step to right increases the number of idle-calls. Quick way to find
  good position: boot to WB, move slider right step by step until FPS drops below 50fps then move the
  slider back left two steps. (setting depends on host CPU speed, there is no good default value, yet)
- CPU idle is always disabled in A500-speed mode (only caused trouble)
- increased the size of DirectInput buffers, no more lost input events when moving mouse very quickly
  and/or using high mouse refreshrates.
- copper SKIP-instruction fix (fixes TEK's Rampage -demo partially, later part still crashes)
- uncompressed statefiles can be created by selecting "uncompressed" from "save as type"-select box
- CIA TOD fix (ALRM-interrupt is disabled when TOD is stopped, fixes Entity, which by the way has
  very buggy level 2 interrupt handler..)
- fixed bsdsocket bug that caused hangups when transferring ftp data with diropus (Stephan Riedelbeck)

Beta 3

- AGA BRDBLANK-bit partially supported. Fixes Aladdin AGA. NOTE: running utilities
  that toggle BRDBLANK-bit doesn't update top and bottom border correctly yet.
- better (?) Pentium 4 JIT fixes merged from latest BasiliskII JIT (Bernd Roesch)
- added PAL and NTSC -strings to 50/100 and 60/120 vsync frequencies
- random sound popping fixed (workaround was to enter and exit the GUI)
- fixed freezing if RDTSC's contents suddenly jumped very far, this usually happens
  when returning from hibernate-mode or waiting for a long time in GUI before returning.
  (Bernd Roesch & me)
- more display updates, fixes Wild Streets (and hopefully doesn't break anything..)
- fixed bug in CDTV battery backed RAM emulation (newer CDTV extended ROMs don't freeze anymore)
- turbo-floppy mode supports writing (earlier versions only "turboed" reading)
- fixed writing to multiple floppies simultaneously
  (for example SuperDuper with multiple destination drives selected)
- proper CIA OVL bit emulation (fixes very tricky CAPS Double Dragon 2 protection code)

Beta 2

- more audio tweaks, Liverpool works again
- implemented Picasso96 RAM state file support, added "hooks" for saving/restoring full state
- ADKCON UARTBRK-bit really works now (was commented out in beta 1)
- display emulation update, fixes Eliminator and Double Dragon 2 graphics corruption.
- major disk emulation bug fixed, could cause frozen write operation and disk corruption..
- compressed statefile support. Statefile's RAM contents are automatically compressed when saving.
  also added support for loading (g)zipped statefiles.
- GPF bug fixed when program counter was pointing to random address in 32-bit space in 24-bit mode
  Fixes "more compatible"-mode only, non-compatible still crashes (not easy to fix without
  performance problems or big changes), ce-mode already worked without crashing.
- fixed bug in saveimage-support, compressed disk images can now be write-enabled.
- implemented very simple code that approximates the number of cycles that bitplane DMA steals from the blitter.
  Now it is possible to run some games/demos without graphics glitches in non-cycle exact mode
  (for example PP Hammer and Spindizzy Worlds)
- screenshots are saved to <winuae directory>\ScreenShots -directory
- more CIA serial port emulation updates
- fixed crash when creating empty CD32 NVRAM image file

Beta 1

- input configuration autofire settings weren't saved properly
- Terrorpods background graphics fixed
  (Game writes to BLTCON1, BLTAFWM and BLTALWM after writing to BLTSIZE..)
- disable Windows screensaver when WinUAE is active and GUI is not visible
- disable middle mouse button events when "Middle Mouse-Button -> ALT-TAB" is enabled.
  (caused stuck middle mouse button because release event never arrived..)
- fixed crash when zlib.dll was missing and (g)zipped image was selected
- changing floppy image and clicking "Reset Amiga"-button booted from old image
- added hackish support for AGA only feature that allows sprites outside display window,
  fixes Banshee AGA scoreboard and AB3D background graphics, will cause small (?)
  performance loss only when program uses this feature.
- fixed ancient blitter bug, writing to address 0 was ignored. Fixes CAPS Guy Spy and Dragon's Lair.
- small "delayoffset" fix, fixes Skeleton Krew's jumpy scrolling
- floppies-tab floppy drive type/disable/enabled state select boxes didn't update internal state correctly
- DSKREADY-signal fix. DSKREADY is only low when motor is running full speed and disk is in drive.
  (confirmed with my real A1200 and 2 external drives, drive always turns motor off if floppy is ejected)
  Pango (and probably others too) use this signal to detect disk changes..
- another audio bug fix, caused missing samples/noise with some music players
- partially rewritten serial code, emulated Amiga's DTR,RTS,CD,CTS and DSR lines are
  directly "connected" to PC serial port pins, ADKCON UARTBRK-bit supported, SERDATR status bits
  and serial interrupts are (nearly) properly timed. Configurable hardware CTS/RTS handshaking.
  Of course PC hardware have some limitations: DTR and RTS are output only and
  CD, CTS and DSR are input only. WARNING: may not be 100% bug free yet..

R5: (28.02.2003)

Beta 8 (final?)

- GUI problems in fullscreen mode fixed
- audio bug fixed, fixes Impossible Mission II
- another last minute change: (I really can't stop adding new features..)
  added HDF filesystem selection GUI. Simply select path to Amiga
  filesystem driver (FastFileSystem from WB1.3:L when booting HDF's
  under KS 1.3, SmartFileSystem if you want to boot SFS formatted HDF
  etc..) No more playing with roms-directory and hexadecimal names.

Beta 7 (Release candidate, expected release date 27-28/2):

- Murder/Crack Down audio hack-fix removed. (not needed anymore).
  This must mean my audio emulation updates are correct :)
  Fixes Terrorpods.
- extended adf2 support fix (loading of non-RAW tracks failed)
- implemented input-tab GUI support for 1-4 input events/input source
- Windows 9x crash fixed
- reverted back to beta 5 serial port code, there is no time to
  fix all bugs now in new code. Later..

Beta 6:

- audio quality should be "perfect" again
- sound-"resync" code re-enabled, vsync should be 100% smooth again
  (was accidentally disabled in beta 5)
- disabled floppy drive's motor state is cleared when restoring state
  (no more disabled drives and green leds)
- improved fake-RDB-filesystem loader, it is now possible to autoboot/mount
  custom filesystem formatted regular HDF-files. (SFS, PFS etc..)
  Requires filesystem driver in WinUAE's roms-directory, named filesystem's
  "dostype in hexadecimal.fs". For example SFS's dostype is 0x53465300, file must
  be named 53465300.fs (I know, not very logical but that was too easy to implement..)
- some serial port compatibility "fixes", serial port support may not work...

Beta 5:

- sound quality fixed (I think so..)
- removed debug code that disabled "fast copper"
- enabled very experimental 4 channel DirectSound audio code.
  Amiga's 4 separate audio channels are directly fed to DirectSound
  instead of using UAE's software mixing.
  NOTE: currently 4+ speaker systems get strange results: each Amiga
  channel goes to separate speaker.. (1 goes to front left, 2 goes
  to front right, 3 goes to rear left and 4 goes to rear right..)
  Not tested with 2 speaker systems..
  Enable with "-dsaudiomix" -command line parameter.
  I'll try to fix the speaker problem if this is useful feature (= increases
  performance noticeably compared to software mixing)
- sound interpolation-checkbox fixed and added support for both modes
  (btw, are interpolation modes broken or why do they sound so bad?)
- Amiga program p96refresh let you choose higher mousepointer refreshrates in P96
  p96refresh <frequency 50-200> (Bernd Roesch)
- native interface added to allow executing windows DLL from 68k side (Bernd Roesch)

Beta 4:

- fixed Competitor PC joystick interface compatibility problem
- fixed CAPS image crash when reading non-existing tracks
- track >79 compatibility fix (Pinball Hazard)
- added OS version to winuaebootlog.txt
- floppy speed slider GUI update fix
- copper COPJMP fix (CAPS Wreckers)
- audio updates and hack that fixes Murder, Crack Down and Liverpool
  AUDxDAT should now work correctly
  (rewrote audio state machine emulation. Yeah, I know I shouldn't do
  these kind of near-last minute changes but... Complain loudly if sound
  works badly)
- keyboard led update, update led state only max once/frame,
  only change selected leds' state
- resetting or reinserting disk image didn't always release old image
- changing floppy drive type or enabling/disabling floppy drives
  works properly when emulation is active

Beta 3:

- OpenGL <15 bit depth check should only be done when using fullscreen mode
- more CIA keyboard emulation fixes (CAPS R101)
- CPU status register emulation fix, bits 14 (T0) and 12 (M) are 68020+ bits
  and must always be zeroed in 68000 mode. (CAPS Toki copy protection code)
- new extended adf2's contains free space for 83 tracks (was 80)
- added disk write-protection support GUI. moved drive disable-checkboxes to
  drive-type box. This is quite complex internally..
  - images that support writing (regular and ext2 adf)
    - checked = read-only flag set
    - unchecked = read-only flag removed
  - read-only images (caps,fdi,ext adf,compressed images):
    - checked:
      - save-image exists and is not empty: save-image's read-only flag is set
      - save-image exists and is still empty: delete save image
      - no save-image: do nothing
    - unchecked:
      - save-image exists: remove read-only flag
      - no save-image: create empty saveimage
  - save images are always created in <winuae root>/SaveImages -directory
    (because selected "parent" image may be located in read-only media)
  - changing writeprotection state causes automatic disk re-insert
    (eject,2s delay,insert)
- state files are now saved to <winuae root>/SaveStates (was Configurations..)
- keyboard LED GUI (misc-page)
- AGA SHRES sprite bug fix (fixes Super Skidmarks hires-mode cars)
- restoring 68020+ state and CPU speed is set to A500 -> change to fastest possible
- filter END+<any key> key releases

Beta 2.1:

- non-blocksize aligned HDFs work again
- keyboard led code improved and fixed
  configuration file line is now: "keyboard_leds=xxx:yyy,xxx:yyy,xxx:yyy"
  where xxx = "capslock", "numlock" or "scrolllock" and
  yyy = df0,df1,df2,df3,power,hd or cd
  (example: "keyboard_leds=scrolllock:power,capslock:df0")

Beta 2:

- renamed save-images to "<name of original image>_save.adf", original extension is removed
  (for example: Example.ipf -> Example_save.adf) Makes names more logical when this feature
  is used with regular adf-files.
- hardfile/harddrive cache bug fix (SFS formatted hardfiles/harddrives work again)
- Action Replay improvements (Mark Cox)
- it wasn't possible to set input-tab's default mappings to none, fixed
- fixed too small config file description buffer in WinUAE GUI code
- configurable keyboard leds (DF0,DF1,DF2,DF3,POWER,HD and CD)
  No GUI yet. Add "keyboard_leds=xxx,xxx,xx" to config file.
  (num lock, caps lock, scroll lock) xxx = none,DF0,DF1 etc..
  Need Windows9x testing (W9x uses very different way of controlling leds than W2K/XP)
- primary sound buffer option removed and disabled. It is not needed anymore and usually
  only caused strange slowdown problems.
- DirectInput devices were allocated multiple times and never freed
- middle mousebutton in fullscreen mode minimizes WinUAE if
  "Middle-Mouse-Button -> ALT-TAB" is ticked.
- OpenGL-mode is disabled if display depth is lower than 15
- Because Windows DDK can't be downloaded anymore from microsoft.com, I added define to
  sysconfig.h (WINDDK) that can be used to disable compilation of features that need
  DDK includes (Windows 2K/XP CDROM, harddrive support and keyboard leds)
- improved programmable horizontal and vertical timing support. Setting 31KHz native
  mode under Picasso96 display modes (for example writing "setenv picasso96/amigavideo 31khz")
  works mostly but audio isn't too good yet..
- yet another Pentium4 JIT fix, Pagestream crashes without it (Bernd Roesch)


Beta 1:

- restoring state with sound disabled caused crash if state was saved with sound, fixed
- fixed mouse problems in Space Crusade, Billy the Kid and more..
- another fast ram state restore fix
- writing to ext2 images was unstable, fixed
- FPU state save support
- floppy drives' disk change flag wasn't reset when state was restored, fixed
- "save disk image"-support. All writes to images that don't support writing go to separate
  extended adf2-image and reads from already written tracks come from ext2-image instead of
  "main" image. This is especially needed by some future CAPS-images. (There are games that
  want to write to the original disk, for example Pinball Dreams highscores but we can't and
  don't want to modify original images)
  "save image" must be currently created manually by clicking "create custom image" (disk-tab),
  image's name must be <name of original image>.adf (for example, Example.ipf -> Example.ipf.adf)
  Image is write-enabled only if save-image exists and is not read-only.
  Any suggestions for GUI?
- 68000 cpu returns the contents of prefetch register when reading from address that does
  not exist. (for example reads from 0x200000 without real fast ram)
- CIA serial port emulation updates. Fixes Back to the Future 2's keyboard freeze.
  (fixes probably other games' keyboard problems too)
- another "last_custom_value"-update, fixes more slowram detection crashes (Commando etc..)
- another bsdsocket emulation fix (Stephen Riedelbeck)
- added configurable device name and boot priority for volumes and hardfiles
- "more compatible" 68000-mode accidentally used some cycle-exact-only functions
- CD32 media change detection fixed (only worked in 0821R1..)
- CD32 pads are now enabled even in non-cd32 mode if configured in input-tab


---
R4

Beta 3:

- switching between windowed and fullscreen disabled sound
  (does not happen with some sound drivers), fixed
- Caps lock fixed (again..)
- build-in DMS support. Will be removed if someone complains..
  (Xdms.exe is really too limited..)
- CTRL-AMIGA-AMIGA-ALT hard-reset works again
- Debugger's S-command used non-binary mode to save files, fixed
- DENISEID-register last_custom fix (fixes Alien Breed - Tower Assault)
- added support for 1.5MB bogoRAM expansion
- another ACTION_RENAME-bug fixed. Rename created new unneeded
  __uaefsdb-entry if only filename's case changed
  (for example: "rename file.txt file.TXT")

Beta 2:

- sound timing always defaulted back to PAL when WinUAE lost or gained focus, fixed.
- Voyage by Razor1991 really works but only randomly
  (requires cycle-exact mode and might need multiple tries, more improved ce-mode needed..)
- CAPS-format support added.
  Needs CAPSImg.dll from CAPS. Not yet available for public.
  Send your questions about Caps directly to http://www.caps-project.org/
  I don't answer any Caps-specific questions.
- use QueryPerformanceCounter() instead of RDTSC if CPU throttling is detected.
  Fixes slowdown problems on laptops, also old processors without RDTSC should run WinUAE again
  without crashing.
- ALT-TAB keyboard fix
- joystick layout B fire fixed (broke in B1)
- joystick configuration bug fix (sometimes joystick didn't work..)
- Picasso96 framebuffer access speedup (Bernd Roesch)

Beta 1:

- improved FPS-counter, added FPS-counter led.
- added blitter fill-mode cycle diagram. Enabling fill mode adds DMA channel C to
  cycle diagram even if it is disabled in BLTCON0. Fixes "Reflect - Sound Vision"
- Catweasel MK3 Amiga keyboard and joystick ports support and Z2-board emulation implemented
- emulate serial port transmit interrupts even if serial port is disabled
  I don't think we can expect users to enable serial emulation to run some games
  that don't even have serial-link option. (Dragon's Lair 2, Moonwalker etc..)
- removed exclusive mouse-mode, mouse handling should be now more compatible.
- faster Picasso96 color fades (Bernd Roesch)
- CD-led is now lit when CD32 audio track is playing
- RDB filesystem loader compatibility fix, SmartFileSystem 1.58 doesn't crash anymore
- filesystem: _UAEFSDB.___ handling fixes, also deletes "ghost"-entries automatically
  (files/directories that are deleted outside of emulation)
- filesystem: ACTION_RENAME fixes. Old name's opened locks and filehandles are transferred
  to new name, filehandles are temporarily closed during rename (under AmigaDOS it is
  possible to rename files that are open) Fixed some "ghost"-UAEFSDB entry-bugs.
- filesystem: added notification support (ACTION_ADD_NOTIFY, ACTION_REMOVE_NOTIFY)
- filesystem: added code that updates parent directory's modification time when file is
  created, written, deleted or renamed. (NTFS does all except rename, FAT apparently never
  updates parent directory's modification time)
  Fixes Directory Opus and DosControl automatic directory list refresh when using FAT
- log messages that arrive before emulation starts are written to winuaebootlog.txt
- uaescsi.device reset crash fixed (happened only under Win9x)
- custom chip "last_custom_value"-update. Fixes Lotus 3 (and probably some other programs')
  slow ram detection.
- CIA and MOVEM M->R cycle usage fixes (Voyage - Razor1991 works now, first boot only...)
- allocate bigger MIDI sysex buffer to prevent overflows (Bernd Roesch)
- disabled mostly useless JIT-log messages (can be enabled by defining JIT_DEBUG and recompiling)
- PAUSE-key = pause emulation. PAUSE+END = full speed emulation (sound is turned off)

Mouse code is mix between old and new WinUAE mouse code. It probably have some bugs..

Filesystem compatibility should be much better now. Could someone test programs that have refused
to install/run under older UAE filesystem versions?


---

RC:

- floppy drive leds light correctly (stupid bug)
- small CIA fix (reading $BFE001 returns correct power led state)
- Input-tab keyboard configuration works again (why didn't nobody notice?)

Beta 3:

- all hardfiles/harddrives described in default.uae were never freed making them unavailable
  if other configuration was loaded and it used same hardfiles as default.uae. fixed.
- mouse counter overflow limit works again (moving mouse very fast made mouse jump around under
  KS 1.3 and some mouse controlled games)
- Amithlon partition detection failed if drive had >6 partitions. fixed.
  (Partition table buffer was too small...)
- non-Amiga formatted or non-empty harddrive safety test can be disabled with
  "-disableharddrivesafetytest" command-line parameter. WinUAE also shows warning
  messages if "dangerous" harddrives are detected and test is disabled

Beta 2:

- A500-speed slowdown problems fixed (*)
- "The selected screen mode can't be displayed in a window, because.." now correctly
  forces fullscreen mode instead of repeating the message forever..
- initial Amiga viewport position fixed

(*) My new Asus A7N8X Deluxe Gold (nForce2) -mainboard arrived today and suprise, suprise,
WinUAE's fps decreased to about 40fps. I finally managed to debug this problem!
It appears calling timeBeginPeriod() and timeEndPeriod() too many times/frame
caused big slowdown. I still don't understand why it only affects some systems..
(probably it depends on drivers because I didn't reinstall OS)

Beta 1b:

- removed debugging code that disabled RDB custom filesystem

Beta 1:

- Ports-tab crash fixed (printer detection bug)
- some joysticks had joystick axis in wrong order (for example Y before X etc..)
- only first joystick worked in input-tab
- plus other joystick bugs fixed
- WinUAE window position in registry is now correct
- hard drive configuration save fix (some harddrive ID's had trailing spaces)
- fixed stuck keys when switching between WinUAE and Windows
- sprite fix (flashing garbage in Pinball Dreams)
- added Harddisk and CD-leds that flash during HD/CD access
- thread priority tweaks
- Windows 95 setupapi.dll error fixed

R2:

Beta 7:

- screenshot changes, PrintScreen -> Windows clipboard
  (now works even in overlay-mode) and PrintScreen + END
  -> screenshot file (was F11)
- more disk emulation updates ("The Deep" works again)
- bsdsocket changes. Fixes Win98 dialing, TCP-device
  and Amygate (Stephan Riedelbeck)

Beta 6:

- primary sound buffer checkbox can be changed on the fly
- floppy buffer overflow fixed
- RDB filesystem bug fix
  caused memory corruption if RDB contained non-automountable partition(s)
- ALT-TAB didn't always release mouse capture
- DirectInput device enumeration fixed
- blitter nasty-mode bug fixed (Obliterator and TerrorPods intro graphics corruption)
- Amiga Catweasel ZorroII-board emulation. (ISA-Catweasel supported)
  Device is detected but reading is unreliable due to timing problems either in
  isacatweasel.device or timer.device in JIT mode. No GUI config, to enable emulation
  add "catweasel_io=xxx" to config file. WinIo.dll, WinIo.sys (2K/XP) and
  WinIo.VXD (W9x) from http://www.internals.com/utilities/winio.zip required.
  Download Amiga driver from http://www.jschoenfeld.de/ support page
  (ISACatweasel.device for Amithlon)
  New Catweasel MK3 (PCI-version) support will be implemented in future.
  Experimental. Bug reports are probably ignored because this won't be part of
  "official" 0.8.22R2 feature list..
- network printers are listed in ports-tab
- tries to prevent frozen mouse if WinUAE crashes
- Kickstart replacement is now correctly enabled if kick rom was not selected
- disk emulation updates
  fixes for Megalomania, Knightmare, Supaplex etc.. ultra slow loading speed,
  more compatible with some copy protections
- Action Replay support fixed

Beta 5:

- ignore mouse events when WinUAE is not in focus
- disk emulation track length/motor speed fix (Istvn Fabian)
- filesystem "ghost"-file fix
  (but we still have one bug left in ACTION_RENAME that isn't so easy to fix)
- F10 and ALT-keys don't freeze the emulation anymore
- Capital Punishment graphics fix
- Picasso96 COMP-drawing mode don't work correctly in >8bit modes, added
  workaround. (found by Bernd Roesch)
- fixed buggy gfx_opengl_mode and gfx_opengl_bits -configuration entry handling
  (caused duplicate entries)

Beta 4:

- mouse fixes and speed multiplier added to input-tab (100=1x,200=2x,50=1/2x etc..)
- caps lock fixed
- cpu idle changes (still need much better algorithm, later..)
- replaced Sleep() with multimedia timers (much better timer accurary)
  this fix might improve sound with small buffer sizes
- switch from fullscreen/no-vsync to vsync crash fixed (this was a very old bug)
- another old config file compatibility fix

Beta 3:

- keyboard layout "B" firebutton fixed
- startup "detect 16-bit" crash fixed
- copper cycle diagram fix (Chaos Engine AGA/CD32 horizontal line)
- screenshot button was always disabled

Beta 2:

- GUI's hardfile/harddrive size fixed (fractional part was always zero)
- "Use Primary DirectSound buffer"-checkbox fixed
- input-tab's joystick/mouse/keyboard axis/button/key names are now queried from DirectInput
- all keyboard's special keys are also configurable in input-tab
- DirectInput fixes (joysticks work etc..)
- direct harddrive access fixed, >512 byte reads/writes are now working properly.
  (caused "not a dos disk" errors if filesystem block size was > 512)
- added 1024 and 2048 physical blocksize support to direct harddrive access code
- RDB code renames duplicate device names (DH0: -> DH0_0: etc..)
- german keyboard layout "hack" fixed (Bernd Roesch)
- improved keyboard configuration, old keyboard configs are not compatible anymore
- "Pentium 4 JIT"-fix enabled in release build
- state load fixes (replacing KS don't clear chip RAM anymore, another CPU type fix)
  Loading 68020/AGA states files with A500 config should now replace configuration
  correctly (finally..)

Beta 1.1:

- >4G hardfiles really work now
- cpu idle fixed

Beta 1:

- disk emulation fix (High density floppy images in non-"turbo" mode were read too slowly causing
  read errors)
- removed bad disk emulation optimization (froze some custom loaders)
- implemented disk drive type configuration. I had to do this because it is not possible
  to emulate real DD and HD drives 100% correctly automatically and I also wanted to add
  ancient&useless 5.25 drive (A1010) support too :)
- automatically disable "turbo"-floppy speed if using non-standard ADF images
- implemented Kickstart 1.3 hardfile support and some RDB filesystem compatibility bug fixes
  (regular KS1.3 hardfile autoboot/mount requires FastFileSystem from WB1.3:L in roms-directory)
- hardfile code rewritten with full 64-bit support ("unlimited" size)
  supports both TD64 and NSD -style 64-bit access.
  Windows 2000 or XP and NTFS filesystem required (Both W9x and FAT32 are
  limited to max 2G files)
  WARNING: some Amiga disk utilities fail to understand >2G partitions and could
  corrupt big hardfiles! OS3.5+ recommended!
  Only drives that don't contain recognised PC partition table and are either empty or
  contain RDB are available in selection dialog (safety feature)
  Amithlon partition support (partition type 0x76) implemented. NOT TESTED YET!
  WARNING: Bugs could cause lost data! Every read and write access to Amithlon partition
  is tested against partition bounds but better safe than sorry..
- uaehf.device is now threaded (read/write requests are run in background)
- fixed uaehf.device crash with older HDToolBox versions
- removed sectors, surfaces and reserved from harddisk tab
  (IMHO they only need to be in hardfile configuration dialog)
- added missing CPU idle configuration entry
- CPU idle code changes
- added cycle exact configuration entry
- increased directory filesystem emulation cache
  (workaround to randomly disappearing flags/comments)
- CPU model is restored correctly when restoring save state file
- DirectInput keyboard, mouse and joystick interface
  - shift-keys don't get stuck anymore in Pinball Dreams etc..
  - Uses DirectInput's MS supported way of disabling all special keys, only ALT-TAB and
    CTRL-ALT-DEL are left enabled.
  - Uses DirectInput exclusive mouse mode to hide Windows mouse pointer instead of
    old version's "interesting" hack...
  - WARNING: expect to find bugs
  - NOTE: mouse speed might be different because DirectInput reads directly from
    mouse driver. (no acceleration etc..)
- mouse input-configuration changed (separated horiz and vertical axis and mouse
  wheel is now third axis)
- "disable Windows keys"-checkbox removed. Windows keys are now always disabled.
  (I added disable checkbox because wkeykill.dll was unsupported hack and could have
  caused problems in some situations) Complain if there is need to not disable
  Windows keys.
- some old config file compatibility fixes
- "compatible" cpu mode checkbox was ignored
  (This was the reason why 0822R1 needed cycle-exact mode to run C64 tune disk)
- 68000 RESET-instruction's prefetch emulation fixed
- CIA overlay-bit fix (regs.pc_p and regs.pc_oldp wasn't updated)
- added Kickstart ROM path to state files (only used when restoring if file exists)

0.8.22R1:

Beta 5:

- RDB custom filesystem fixes
- make "regular" hardfiles invisible to HDToolbox
- fix CD32 pad emulation in compatibility mode

Beta 4:

- small sound changes: AHI sound disabled when resetting the Amiga, DirectSound is freed
  when WinUAE is minimized and "Disable sound output" is ticked.
- input-tab autofire rate fixed
- fixed fast memory state save bug
- joystick compatibility mode fixes
- another uaescsi.device compatibility fix

Beta 3:

- AVIOutput fix (editing parameters didn't work until emulation was started)
- centering works again (broke in beta 2)
- more uaescsi.device compatibility fixes (all Amiga CD filesystems should now work properly)
- CD32 pad emulation fixes
- fixed crash when "ejecting" broken zipped adf-files
- bsdsocket fixes (Stephan Riedelbeck)
- exception 3 handling fixed (was broken by JIT fix ages ago..)
- improved RDB filesystem relocator (fixes PFS3 and others)
- screenshot key shortcut mapped to F11
- multiple sound card support (original GUI code by Brian King)
- fixed programs that use POTxDAT to read second fire button (was broken ages ago)

Beta 2:

- UAE 0.8.22 merge, bumped version number (most changes were already included in R4)
- switching cycle-exact off does not freeze the emulator anymore (but Amiga still freezes..)
- Action Replay 1 support (breakpoints don't work)
- writing to hardfiles work again
- CPU emulator fix: CHK-instruction's exception return address was wrong (Days of Thunder)
- AVIOutput update (Sane)
- floppy speed slider GUI fixed
- disk emulation initialization fix (fixes A1000 boot failure in non-"turbo" mode)
- CPU idle checkbox works after emulation has been started
- keyboard fix (some key presses were missed when pressing multiple keys)
- sound changes: (yet again...)
  - vsync enabled and/or JIT enabled: adjustment active (like older versions)
  - vsync disabled and JIT disabled: UAE 0.8.22 sound timing (adjustment disabled)
  (JIT will have HUGE slowdown and vsync skips if UAE 0.8.22-style timing is enabled)
  - uses DirectSound primary buffer if possible (SDL does this too)
  - depending on sound card, small buffers (1 and 2) might work very badly..
- uaehf.device scsi emulator fixes
- changed "create hardfile"-dialog's hardfile size to megabytes and added 2GB limit
  (limit will be removed after uaehf.device supports 64-bit addressing)
- uaescsi.device reboot crash fixed
- full RDB harddisk image support (automount, custom filesystems etc..)

Beta 1: (too many changes, expect breakage..)

- unoptimized near cycle-exact cpu and blitter emulation implemented (checkbox in misc-tab)
  Fixes most programs that expect correct cpu and blitter speed (PP Hammer, many demos etc..)
  WARNING: requires at least 50%+ more cpu power than "regular" mode.
  Athlon XP/Pentium IV + DDR/RAMBUS RAM highly recommended!
  WARNING2: Frameskip must be set to 1
  WARNING3: very experimental, timing is quite far from perfection
  Complain loudly if "regular" mode is slower. (It shouldn't be but you never know..)
- yet another 68000 prefetch emulation rewrite (fixes "100 most remembered C64 games" and more..)
- OpenGL scanline brightness slider added
- yet another disk emulation update
  (more compatible, stupid extended adf bug fixed that caused format/verify errors)
- interlace mode vsync fixed (no more 2x speed)
- added support for compressed kickstart rom-images
- encrypted A1000 boot rom support added
- 64kb A1000 boot rom supported (A1000 boot rom size is really 64kb even if only first 8kb is used..)
- 256kb chip RAM support added (first A1000s come with 256kb chip RAM as standard, expandable to 512kb)
- dms files inside zip -crash fixed
  (xdms.exe that does not add .dms extension to source file's name needed for correct decompression support)
- fixed com-port warning (start emulation, press F12, select input-tab)
- sprite-playfield collision fix (fixes Inferior but may break something else.. Testing needed!)
- display garbage fix (Nightbreed Interactive Movie, some demos)
- input device support updates
  defaults added to mouse and joysticks, mouse didn't always work correctly,
  autofire works now properly, supports max 4 input targets/input source
  (currently only available by manually editing configuration files,
  example: input.1.mouse.0.button.0=JOY1_FIRE_BUTTON.0,JOY2_FIRE_BUTTON.0)
- another experimental cpu idle hack (detects when Kickstart executes STOP-instruction)
  lowers host CPU usage near zero when emulated system is idle.
- added cpu idle checkbox to GUI CPU-page
- new AHI code and driver (Bernd Roesch)
- Amiga <> Windows clipboard support, see winuaeclip.txt for more information (Bernd Roesch)
- added device io (CMD_READ, CMD_CHANGESTATE etc..) support to uaescsi.device
  no need to enable direct-scsi anymore, also media change detection
  (ADDCHANGEINT/REMCHANGEINT) is emulated properly. This means uaescsi.device emulation should
  now work properly with all available cd file systems without special mountlist flags.
- fixed bug in state save restore code, sometimes restored floppy drive track was incorrect
- added wkeykill.dll support. Kills all normal Windows key combinations (except some keys don't
  work properly on WXP, for example LWin+L, hopefully this can be fixed later..)
  Unfortunately it is not possible to integrate Windows key kill code to WinUAE because it seems
  it is only possible to kill Windows key events properly from a separate dll..
- Amiga-"viewport" is now centered correctly, no more clipped window borders
- FPU emulator's precision was poor, fixed (cause: wrong compiler optimization parameters)
- filesystem bug fix (hopefully fixes bug that causes random files appearing as directories)
- on the fly switching between OpenGL and DirectDraw mode
- on the fly switching between vsync and non-vsync mode
- DirectSound sound code is back with auto-adjust. Better or worse than old code?
  (I replaced SDL audio because it is now confirmed that SDL audio has strange lag
  problems with some systems. I might include both, depends on test results..)
- audio emulation fix (Mission Elevator)
  also some AUDxDAT fixes (fixes random CD32 boot tune noise)
- build-in screenshot function (original code by Sane)
  supports all modes: DirectDraw, DirectDraw Overlay, OpenGL and Picasso96
  current shortcut key: END+F6 (Suggestions?)
- set active WinUAE process priority level higher, improves smoothness
  makes Windows' responsiveness worse but I hope it isn't too bad..
- decreased trackdisplay leds' brightness slightly
- writing to kickstart rom memory area crashed the system if JIT was enabled
- floppy speed slider (I know I shouldn't put it back but I got too many requests..)
- second filesystem bug fix: situations where file read length was very big were not handled correctly
- third filesystem bug fix: CON.something, AUX.something etc. are not valid Windows filenames
- added simple "scsi emulator" to uaehf.device. It is now possible to edit full harddisk images with hdtoolbox
  ("hdtoolbox uaehf.device". Sectors, surfaces and reserved can be set to zero)
  not very useful feature because booting/automounting does not work yet...

- *.zip added to disk image selector
- Caps Lock and misc keyboard fixes (new input device mode only)
- return random bits if program is trying to read track past image's end (Typhoon Thompson)
- yet another sprite emulation rewrite. Report immediately if you notice missing/flashing/corrupt etc sprites!

- joystick/mouse -> keyboard mapping fixed
- keyboard -> Amiga joystick/mouse/keyboard configuration implemented (US keyboard layout only)
- another copper skip fix (fixes Rainbow Islands)
- CPU idle patch
- MIDI fixes (Bernd Roesch, Alfred J. Faust)

Beta 4:

- better Superfrog/Exile etc.. border fix (old version caused display problems with some demos)
- new input device configuration is finally working
  TODO:
  - more intuitive GUI (Help needed)
  - add international key names
  - implement multiple mouse support
    Unfortunately it seems DirectInput don't support multiple mouse on W2K/XP.
    http://www.angelfire.com/retro/u_rebelscum/faqs.html#win2000limit
    (confirmed with two USB mouse on WXP)
  - PC keyboard -> Amiga mouse/joystick/keyboard mapping editor
- OpenGL tweaks (scaling changed, 0,0,0,0 = centered screen. Added default-button)
- misc-tab changes (disabled state save-button if emulator is not started, reset and quit-buttons are always visible)
- GUI remembers last used property page (tab)
- two executables, one compiled with MSVC 7 (MSVS.net) and the other with MSVC 6.

Beta 3:

- HOME + F5 opens state restore dialog and SHIFT + HOME + F5 opens state save dialog
- experimental OpenGL support
  internal window size is always 752*600 (376*300 if lores is enabled and linedoubling is off)
  image size configuration
  scanline emulation (transparency and size)
  requires 1024 * 1024 or larger supported texture size (won't work with old cards)
- AVIoutput improvements (can be started later, stops when re-entering GUI, vsync-waits ignored)
- Picasso96/native mode switching should be working again (was broken in beta 1 and 2)
- Superfrog, Exile etc.. left border bug fixed
- adz support fixed
- CIA alarm update (fixes Torvak the Warrior's music)

Beta 2:

- build-in gzip and zip support (autoselects first adf-image or Amiga executable if zip contains multiple files)
- executable to adf support, just "insert" Amiga executable in to floppy drive
- improved external decompression support (currently only xdms.exe),
  temporary files are loaded back in to memory and deleted immediately after decompression.
- 50/60/100/120Hz frequencies are now always selectable. I think this allows vsync-support with display drivers
  that don't support frequency selection but support custom resolutions (for example with PowerStrip)
- Picasso96 Drawstudio fix (Bernd Roesch)
- removed 8/16-bit sound selection from gui. Sound is now always 16-bit.
- sound adjust slider reimplemented. (fully automatic sound adjust seems to be impossible..)
  sound code is still autoadjusting but with very limited adjustment range
  (allows 100% smooth vsync at least on my pc..)

  adjustment instructions: move slider left until sound doesn't crackle anymore (no more sound buffer underflows)
  adjustment position isn't very important except if you want vsync without random skips.

Beta 1:

- fixed right border garbage (CD32 bootscreens and other programs)
- "16-bit mode detect" does not crash anymore if registry keys are not found
- vsync updates, vsync can be enabled or disabled during the emulation
- Picasso96 JIT memory mapping update (Bernd Roesch)
- Refresh rate selection only affects Amiga display modes, Picasso96 always uses default refresh rate
- CIA changes

R3:

Beta 3:

- missing gui-tabs fixed (was broken in beta 2) (me)
- serial port update (Bernd Roesch)
- cycle exact bitplane modulo emulation (fixes Lemmings 3 AGA) (me, Bernd Schmidt)
  I think this patch is finally bug free. Report immediately if you see display corruption!
- modified delayoffset hack (fixes Mindriot-demo) (me)

Beta 2:

- AGA mode EHB fix (Superfrog title screen) (me)
- hardfile sectorsperblock fix (Reorg works again) (from WinUAE 0817)
- CIA update (better compatibility with some weird programs) (me)
- PC joystick in both joystick ports works again (was broken in every 0821 release) (me)
- icon fixed (no more random pixels) (me)
- Picasso96 overlay mode is working again (was broken in beta 1) (me)
- Shapeshifter-checkbox fixed (from WinUAE 0817)
- JIT shift-instruction fix (from Basilisk JIT)

Beta 1: (VSync test beta)

- joystick keyboard emulation do not anymore create normal key presses
- sprite update (no more flashing bees in Superfrog)
- CIA update (fixes Powermonger, thanks to Istvn Fbin)
- VSync and separate refresh rate selection added
  I had to implement this because I got too many requests :)
- requires DirectX 7 or newer (was DX5 or newer)
- Picasso96 and other misc updates (Bernd Roesch)

to do: input device configuration GUI

R2:

Beta 6:

- sprite emulation changes (me)

Beta 5:

- WBStartup filesystem fix (Bernd#1)

- fixed missing CD32 audio if all floppy drives are disabled (me)
- bsdsocket fix (Stephan Riedelbeck)
- added ASPI/SPTI SCSI layer selection (me)
  Currently only ASPI supports non-CDROM devices (except harddisks due to security reasons)
- ASPI and SPTI code swaps SCSI bus and target if all units' target and lun is zero (me)
  Only affects IDE devices (ASPI sets every IDE device to different "SCSI"-bus causing strange
  uaescsi.device unit numbers)

Beta 3:

- fixed nasty and very old memory overwrite bug in keyboard_win32.c (me)
- SPTI uaescsi.device emulation works again (me)
- uaescsi.device ignored io error return codes, fixed. (stupid me)

- added missing #define USE_X86_FPUCW 1 (Bernd#3)
- serial port fix (Bernd#3,me)

Beta 2:

- this time really fixed max sound buffer crash (me)
- added Bernd#1's vsynctime "fix"
- JIT FPU fix (Bernd#3)
- filesystem A-flag handling was reversed (Stephan Riedelbeck)
- filesystem fixes (Bernd#1,me)
- blitter timing bug fix (stupid me, yet again)
- removed useless refresh rate from display mode selection box
- fixed crash if RTG was enabled and Z3 memory size was 8MB (Bernd#3)
- noticed problems with uaescsi.device SPTI support, uses ASPI until problem is solved.
- added more uaescsi.device logging (drive names and unit numbers)

Beta 1:

- filesystem fix (Bernd#1) Fixes at least some problems. Testing needed!
  (Bernd: I only merged your first patch, second file order "fix" is not enabled)
- if JIT is disabled, disable "force settings" too (me)
- joystick 2 fixed (me)
- AR "freeze"-button was pressed when exiting GUI, fixed (me)
- memory leak and small bsdsocket fix (Stephan Riedelbeck)
- clear extended rom and cartridge rom configuration entries when loading new config (me)
- pressing F12 and then later pressing shift doesn't start debugger anymore (me)
- sprite fix (me)
- Windows 2000/XP CDROM detection fix (CD32 and uaescsi.device)
- re-enabled full-row-select option (config load/save and hard drives -tabs)
- sound changes. Does this fix crashes and/or bad sound?
- copper fix (Bernd #1)
- CTRL-AMIGA-AMIGA-ALT resets and clears chipmemory (removes all reset proof programs)

Beta 6:

- rare keyboard freeze fixed (caused by fault AR3 keyboard hack)
- blitter nasty fix

Beta 5:

- added missing Bernd#3's serial port update
- Battle Squadron sprite fix (me)
- copper fix (Bernd#1)
- filesys seek fix (Bernd#3)

- fix stupid blitter cycle diagram bug (stupid me)

Beta 3: 

- another bsdsocket fix (Bernd Roesch)
- midi in/out selection boxes added (me)
- filesys fix (Bernd Schmidt)
- Action Replay 2/3 support, freeze button = PageUp (me)
- serial/parallel port updates (Bernd Roesch)
- VPOSW refreshrate hack support added (me)
- copper timing updates
- some missed fixes from 0.8.21

Beta 2:

- maximun screen height increased (600 -> 1280)
- uaelib updates
- middle button = alt-tab fixed
- added track display enable/disable button
- better blitter patch
- AviOutput sound capture added
- >2MB Chip works again
- Z3RAM can be larger than 64MB
- default.uae fixed
- missing call to bsdsocket.library initialization added
- "Add PC drives" fixed (CDROM drives are ignored)
  I think it is better to use uaescsi.device to access removable (CDROM) drives. Any comments?

Beta 1:

- full CD32 emulation
- uaescsi.device Win32 port
- blitter "fix" (fixes Desert Dream freeze and Hostages insta-kill)
- input device rewrite (no config file save/load and gui yet, not very useful now..)
- Sane's AviOutput (no sound support yet due to changes in 0820 Win32 audio code)
- JIT + some fixes (I decided to drop "JIT"-part from the name)
