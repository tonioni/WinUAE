Some words
----------
 And here is another release. Long time since the last :(. Anyway, as
promised, I put this version online in the hope it will behave correctly
everywhere .. feedback plz !.

 here are some things one ought to know about possible 'failure' of
Pro-Wizard-1 (for PeeCee) ... meaning this prog might overlook or mistake
some formats. The "sensibles" formats are :
 - Noisepacker v1 and v2
  (these two formats are VERY similars ... a NP1 can be recognised as a NP2.
   Rather harmless I should says, but ..)
 - Unic tracker v1 and v2
  (These two formats can be recognised as the other ... or even as a ptk but
   this very case has 0.01% chance to happen :). The first case, however, is
   most probable ... . The difference isn't that important, mind .. a title !)
 - The Player 6.0A and 6.1A with packed samples are on hold. Jarno *did*
  answer my old email (thx man !) and sent me a thorough description on
  how to depack samples. Sadly, I've no time at all to do that these days.

 Most of the depackers included are still real gibberish code. I've rewritten
quite a few yet, but I've found it's very expensive in time to rewritte
lame old code :(. Not sure I'll finnish this ... .

 I've depacked NoiseTracker pack a long time ago ... but I wont include this
format in ProWiz bcoz my depacker isn't 100% reliable :(. The fact is that
if there are Arpeggii in the music, I cant find any single way to detect it.
contact me for more infos :), I'll send you the description I've made ..
reliable this one !.

 One word about the packed data files ... . I've included these format
because I'm fed-up doing it handly with Hex-ed !. The ripped files are 
STILL packed !, and you'll need to depack them with tools like XfdDecrunch. 
If you know how to depack these, you're welcome to send me some source
code (68k or not).
 Also, I've expanded this to other fairly well used packed EXE. Yet, I still
dont know how to depack this by myself. Extracting that way saves hours of
Hex-work .. at least for me :).

 One word about JamCracker. Xag version (JamCracker Pro 1.0A) saves a 19 bytes
title at the end of the module. Prowiz for PC doesn't rip it since it's NOT
in the original format. That's the only difference in the two versions (even
if Xag's doc says there's no diff ...). So, if you want the title, just check
the 19 bytes after the module.

 About Sound FX format, v1.3 and v1.8 are the same. Note that I attempted a
conversion to ptk ... but most of the effects are not supported ... simply
because I dont know what they do .. (doc please !). So, the conversion is
only at a beta stage ... the rip is ok though :).
